                    <p class="descr">The majority of distribution system faults start as line-ground (L-G) faults. Accordingly, attention has been given to grounding or isolation of neutral points of sources and transformers and L-G fault protection. Understanding L-G faults is indispensable for achieving the correct balance between different protection aspects such as coordination, selectivity, speed and economics. Continuity of power supply is critical for many industrial systems, meanwhile, quick fault identification and quick protection tripping reduces the risk of fault advancement into multiple phase faults with damaging currents, arc flash energies and associated hazards. Several computer programs provide great tools for short circuit calculations and relay coordination. However, it is important for electrical engineers and system designers to augment the use of computer programs with comprehensive understanding of their systems. One of the brilliant calculation methods, introduced in 1917 and still being used, is the symmetrical components method. In addition to the introduction of symmetrical components, this tutorial includes discussion on system neutral grounding, medium and low voltage cable and system capacitances, high and low resistance grounding and protection for L-G faults. Relevant IEEE Standards for Recommended Practices in Industrial and Commercial Power Systems (Series 3000) will be identified and discussed.</p>

                    <h4>Tutorial 3. Wireless Communications with Energy Harvesting Nodes</h4>
                    <p>Md. Jahangir Hossain (The University of British Columbia – Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada)<br/> 
                    Imtiaz Ahmed (McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada)</p>
                    <p class="descr"><strong class="subsec">OUTLINE:</strong> <br/>
                    <p class="descr">Energy harvesting (EH) has attracted considerable attention from academia and industry as an environmentally friendly supply of energy for the wireless communication nodes. In practice, the transmitter and receiver nodes in communication systems expend their energy for processing and transmitting data. Connecting these transceiver nodes to the power grid is cumbersome for some applications and in other cases, may not even be possible. For instance, it is highly inconvenient to run the power cables in order to energize small sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. Pre-charged batteries can be a viable solution to this problem. However, in practice, the limited storage capacity of the batteries and high transmit powers may result in the quick drainage of the batteries. As a result, the batteries need to be periodically replaced or recharged, which can be impractical as well. For example, wireless sensor nodes can be placed in a toxic or hazardous environment that prohibits human intervention. In these situations, deploying EH nodes is an alternative solution. EH nodes harvest energy from the renewable sources of their surrounding environment, convert it to electrical energy, and store the electrical energy in batteries in order to carry out their functions. In general, the energy can be harvested from unused ambient renewable energy sources using solar, thermoelectric, and motion effects, or through other physical phenomena. EH nodes can be regarded as a promising option for deployment as they ensure a long system lifetime without the need for periodic battery replacements. However, using EH nodes for conventional communication systems is not straightforward and requires a careful attention to design communication devices and to develop communication protocols and resource control algorithms. Precisely, the EH systems should be able to manage the harvested energies optimally and efﬁciently in order to achieve the optimal performance while reducing the randomness of the energy availability. Developing new systems or modifying the existing protocols to accommodate the EH capability while controlling communication resources brings many new challenges not only in physical layer but also in higher layers. This tutorial will explore into the design and optimization problems for EH systems and delve into their performance analysis. Starting with the visions and requirements for EH systems, the challenges of radio resource control and allocation (e.g., power control, subcarrier allocation, user scheduling, etc.) will be outlined. Open research issues and possible approaches to tackle those issues will be described. Furthermore, an organization of the related literature addressing the different aspects of EH systems will be provided highlighting the different methodologies adopted for analysis and optimization of EH networks.</p>

                    <p class="descr">The outline of the tutorial is as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Fundamental limits of communications under EH constraints</li>
                    <li>Information theoretic aspects of EH wireless communications</li>
                    <li>EH models and practical considerations towards designing EH nodes</li>
                    <li>Performance analysis of systems energized by renewable energies</li>
                    <li>Radio resource allocation and scheduling in EH networks</li>
                    <li>Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer</li>
                    <li>Energy cooperation and relaying in wireless networks</li>
                    <li>Multi-antenna technologies for EH systems</li>
                    <li>Multi-user systems for EH wireless communications</li>
                    <li>Routing and MAC protocols under EH constraints</li>
                    <li>Cognitive radio design with EH systems</li>
                    <li>Detection, estimation, computation, compression, machine learning, and signal processing for EH systems</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="descr">The emerging 5G wireless networks aim at ensuring various contemporary wireless applications to be served timely and satisfactorily. For instance, while 4G networks provide 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps peak data rates for mobile and ﬁxed users, respectively, 5G networks are envisioned to support 10 times of the peak data rates of 4G. Moreover, 5G networks have been envisaged to reduce the end-to-end latency of 4G networks, which ranges from 100 to 150 ms, by at least an order of magnitude. Supporting higher data rates in a strict delay requirement increases the energy consumption and hence results in a detrimental impact on the environment. This high-energy consumption has been regarded as one of the main challenges to be tackled in 5G communication systems. Among other approaches towards green communications, EH has been regarded as an environmentally friendlier supply of energy for communication nodes compared to traditional sources of energy. Design and optimization of EH systems are potentially a very fertile area of research and are of signiﬁcant interest to researchers from both academia and industry. Therefore, the topic of the tutorial is very timely. The aim of this tutorial is to provide an extensive overview of EH wireless communication systems and the state-of-the-art research on this topic.</p>

                    <p class="descr"><strong class="subsec">OUTLINE:</strong> <br/>
                    <p class="descr">This tutorial describes the fundamentals of social learning and controlled sensing for adaptive decision making. Such tools are essential in the formulation of mathematical models and design of adaptive radars, reconfigurable sensors and social sensing. The tutorial is in three parts. The first part describes several examples. The second part gives a brief introduction to Bayesian estimation and filtering. The final part briefly outlines how stochastic control (partially observed Markov decision processes) can be used to design smart sensing systems.  The tutorial focuses primarily on conceptual formulation and algorithms – it does focus on technology.</p>

                    <p class="descr">Cancer is an evolutionary process comprised of competition between cells with different genomic abnormalities in the tumour. The cells with more advantageous mutations will prevail as they can divide faster compared to the other cells in the tumour. Genome contains all of the information needed to build and maintain an organism. Cancer is a disease of the genome and thanks to next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the cost of turning the genomic information into digital information has dropped dramatically in the past few years. Over the next few years, thousands of individual cancer genomes will be sequenced (>250 GB per patient). These data will provide us with a fine-grained picture of the evolutionary processes that underlie the commonest genetic disease, providing new insights into the origins and new directions for the treatment of cancer.</p> 
                    <p class="descr">Computer scientists play a major role to achieve the aforementioned goals. In this tutorial, we will</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                    <li>explain the entire cancer genomics problem in the context of big data framework, </li>
                    <li>highlight the challenges that cancer researchers are facing in the interpretation of the massive amounts of genomic data, and</li>
                    <li>provide examples of where machine learning and statistical signal processing techniques have played a substantial role in detection and characterization of the genomic signatures of different cancers. In the last part of this tutorial, we will highlight algorithms for learning phylogenies which are widely used for capturing evolutionary processes like cancer. Learning phylogenies can potentially shed light to important phenomena like cancer drug resistance and accumulation of mutations in tumours. We first introduce important classes of algorithms for learning phylogenies such as distance-based algorithms, maximum-likelihood methods, and state-of-the-art Bayesian models. We will also present applications of the above-mentioned algorithms on a real world cancer data set.</li>
