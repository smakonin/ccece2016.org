                    <h4>Visa Letters - Visiting Canada</h4>
                    <h5>Submission of Applications</h5>
                    <p class="descr">Canada does not have a visa office in every country so it is important that delegates visit the website of the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/information/offices/apply-where.asp">visa office responsible for processing their visa applications</a>.  Information is available on the website on how to submit a visa application and the documentation required. Delegates are encouraged to submit their visa applications well in advance of the date of the event at a <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/offices/vac.asp">Visa Application Centre</a> or on-line <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/business.asp">E-applications (e-Apps)</a>.</p>
                    <h5>e-Apps</h5>
                    <p class="descr">This system allows clients to submit applications online. Delegates that need a visa but require their passport for other travel purposes are strongly encouraged to submit their visa applications on-line (<a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/business.asp">e-Apps</a>).  Delegates that choose to apply on-line will not have to submit their passport until a decision has been taken on their applications.  If required, the visa office will send the applicant instructions on how and where to send their passports to finalize the visa process.</p>
                    <h5>Visa Application Centres (VACs)</h5>

                    <p class="descr">VACs are commercial service providers authorized by Canada to provide specific services to applicants. VACs provide a number of services including help applicants fill out forms, answer questions and ensure that applications are complete, thereby reducing unnecessary delays or refusals due to incomplete applications. Applicants that are <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/biometrics2.asp">required to provide biometrics information</a> as part of the visa application process can do so <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/biometrics2.asp">at a VAC</a>.  Additional <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/multimedia/video/biometrics/biometrics.asp">information on the biometrics requirements</a> is available at the IRCC website. VACs send applications to Visa Offices and transmit decisions to applicants in a secure and confidential manner. VACs do not process visa applications and play no role in the decision-making process</p>
                    <h5>Visa Applications Processing Times</h5>
                    <p class="descr">Processing time for visa applications vary depending on the office and the time of the year.  Participants should be encouraged to apply early for their visas, and to submit complete applications including all supporting documents. Please visit the IRCC website for information on <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/temp/visitors.asp">the time it takes to process visa applications</a> at the various visa offices.</p>
                    <h5>NEW - Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) – Effective as of March 15, 2016.</h5>
                    <p class="descr"><a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/acts-regulations/forward-regulatory-plan/eta.asp">eTA</a> is a new requirement for travellers who were previously able to travel to Canada without prior authorization. We invite you to consult the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp">IRCC website</a> regularly for information updates on eTA.</p>
