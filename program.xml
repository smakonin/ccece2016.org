        <papertitle>Detailed Analysis of Radiation-Induced Delays on I/O Blocks of an SRAM-Based FPGA</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we analyze through analytical and experimental means the impact of different SEU induced mechanisms modifying delays in I/O blocks of SRAM-based FPGAs. We propose simple RC delay models for these mechanisms. Our results, obtained through HSPICE simulations and experimental SEU emulation, show the relevance of these delay models. They also show that these mechanisms differ from the ones affecting the FPGA core and routing, and that additional measurements are required to estimate the related delays.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimization of Probability of Error in Collaborative Spectrum Sensing of Time-Limited Cognitive Radio Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>We study probability of error optimization problem in collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) with limited time resources in cognitive radio (CR) networks. The frame structures for sensing and data transmission, if the spectrum is identified as vacant, are both supposed to be fixed. This implies that the time resource dedicated for CSS is limited and shared between spectrum sensing time and results reporting time, which depends on the number of sensing users. So, we consider an optimization problem containing network constraints on time resources for secondary users (SUs) which cooperate with each other by weighted fusion rule. It is assumed that the SUs are in energy-surplus regime and predefined constraint on probability of collision is satisfied to protect the cooperative network performance quality. We analytically prove considered optimization problem is convex to make sure that we can obtain a global solution. Analytical results in addition to simulation results are provided to prove the claims.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Opportunistic Multi-channel MAC protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Due to the fast development of the wireless applications and services, cognitive radio networks have been proposed to dynamically accessing the spectrum to efficiently improve the spectrum utilization. Cognitive Radio users or secondary users (SUs) should enter the licensed channels only when the primary users (PUs) are absent, they also have to release the licensed channel whenever a primary user occupy the channel, in order to limit the interference to the primary users. Managing the spectrum access of the cognitive users is the main rule of the medium access control (MAC) layer, and due to the time varying channel availability this introduces a nontrivial number of design challenges to the MAC layer (e.g. multichannel hidden terminal problem, SUs synchronization, and achieving high throughput with limiting interference to the PUs). In this paper a proposed MAC protocol for ad hoc networks (ACAP-MAC protocol) will be introduced based on seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) forecasting technique, which provides a reliable forecast for the off state time of the primary users to be opportunistically utilized by secondary users. It offers high throughput and low collision rate. OPNET Modeler network simulation tool is used as a powerful tool to collect and show statistics that verify the reliability of the proposed MAC protocol.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Research on the Performance of Overlay / Underlay Cognitive Radio Waveforms in Different Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we first derived the bit error rates for overlay and underlay waveforms respectively. Then according to their waveform characteristics, the short-time frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) signal was used to implement the overlay waveforms and exploit spectrum holes by using; and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signals whose power is below noise's power spectral density was used to implement underlay waveforms and exploit underused frequency bands by using; by adding spread spectrum code sequences of DSSS signals and frequency hopping sequences of FHSS signals, the added signal used to implement hybrid overlay/underlay waveform. In AWGN, RAYLEIGH and RICEAN channels, bit error rates (BER) of overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms are simulated respectively. The results show that hybrid overlay/underlay waveform performance &gt; overlay waveform performance &gt; underlay waveform performance; and underlay waveform allows primary users and secondary users coexist, but when the number of primary users increases, then performance of underlay waveform decreases.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Performance of Eigenvalue Based Spectrum Sensing In Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Spectrum sensing is a key component in any cognitive radio network. Recently full-duplex communication, i.e., the ability to transmit and receive at the same time at the same frequency, has become feasible. Residual self interference is inevitable even after applying self interference cancellation techniques in radio frequency (RF) and baseband domains. In this paper, we study the performance of popular eigenvalue based spectrum sensing techniques under residual self interference. Moreover, we investigate their performance when exploiting the correlation coefficient matrix, rather than the covariance matrix, to estimate the decision statistics. Finally, we propose three new correlation coefficient matrix based algorithms that outperform existing techniques.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Resource Allocation in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks Towards Maritime Cyber Physical Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, an innovative framework labeled as cooperative cognitive Cyber Physical Systems (CCCPSs) on the sea is developed to provide opportunistic channel access. Specifically, a two-phase frame structure is applied to let (Secondary users) SUs entirely utilize the transmission opportunities as the reward by cooperation with (Primary users) PU. Amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying mode is exploited in SU nodes, while Backward induction method based Stackelberg game is employed to achieve optimal determination of SU , power consumption and time portion for cooperation. And the close-form solutions for the PU and SU are derived to realize the Nash Equilibrium. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Selective Decode-and-Forward Two-Way Relay Network with Weighted Decision-Feedback Differential Coherent Detectors</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper considers a selective detect-and-forward two-way relay network employing differential MPSK modulation with Weighted Decision-Feedback Differential Coherent (W-DFDC) receivers. The system employs a three-phase relaying protocol with direct transmissions, where two terminals transmit separately in the first two phases. In the third phase, the relay forwards the network coded message to both terminals only if it has successfully decoded both messages received from the terminals. At the destination nodes, SNR-dependent thresholds are proposed to allow only the received signal from the relay corresponding to when it transmits to be combined with the signal from the direct link. Monte Carlo simulations result for fast fading channels show the performance gains of this relaying scheme with W-DFDC receivers over conventional differential detectors.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Decision-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Using Random Medium Access</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>This article studies the performance of decision-based cooperative spectrum sensing using random medium access. Unlike scheduled medium access, random medium access entails a nonnegligible probability of collision which affects the detection accuracy. Novel closed form expressions are derived for the detection probability, the false alarm probability, and the average reporting time, assuming the absence of a dedicated reporting channel and accounting for decoding errors. Computer simulations are used to verify the accuracy of the derived results.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Transmitter Precoding to Cancel Inter-Relay Interference in AF Systems with Successive Transmissions</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents an inter-relay interference (IRI) cancellation scheme in amplify-and-forward (AF) cellular-type networks with successive downlink forwarding. In these half-duplex alternate relaying systems with two hops, the wireless medium in both hops is always utilized through the simultaneous transmissions of the base station (BS) and one of the relays which in turn causes IRI. In this work, the processing to mitigate IRI is performed exclusively at the BS using channel state information (CSI) between the BS and the multiple relays supporting corresponding receivers. The proposed linear precoding exploits the principles of signal alignment at the BS and considers recursive characteristics of IRI. The scheme performance is affected by the noise accumulation which is controlled in this paper by (i) scheduling relays as to benefit from spatial attenuation of signals and (ii) periodically re-initializing BS transmissions where some of the time slots are not utilized for the BS transmissions. Simulation results show the ability of the new scheme to fully cancel IRI as well as demonstrate the performance trade-offs between the bit error rate (BER) improvements and the loss in throughput efficiency due to flushing.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Adaptive Distributed Compression Technique Utilizing Intermediate Network Nodes</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Data networks are experiencing an unprecedented growth in traffic resulting in a multitude of challenges including high network congestion, latency, and packet loss rates. These challenges greatly affect the performance of the network and have a drastic impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) for various applications. In order to reduce network congestion and in turn, maintain the desired QoS, an adaptive and distributed compression/decompression scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme performs the compression and decompression processes within the queues of the intermediate routing nodes of a network. The payload of a packet is compressed based on the packet queuing time. The average expected queuing time of packets is determined instantaneously within the intermediate nodes of a network by employing the Pollaczek Khinchin (PK) equation. Using Network Simulator 3 (NS3), the proposed scheme was simulated under different network conditions and compared with non-compressed transmission sessions of different flow rates. The simulation results show a dramatic improvement in network performance. More specifically, the number of lost packets and one way latency are reduced by at least 22.50% and 18%, respectively.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Imperfection of Channel Estimation, Relay's Forwarding Policy and Destination's Knowledge of Signal Presence</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we analyze two different decode-and-forward (DF) relay-assisted communication system models, which display different levels of practicality and represent large classes of DF systems in the literature. We spell out delineating aspects of the two models and rigorously show inequality among their symbol error probabilities (SEPs). Both system models assume imperfect channel side information at receivers and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the destination node. </abstract>

        <papertitle>A Robust and Fast Method for Estimating and Tracking the Instantaneous Fundamental Frequency of Audio Signals</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Extended Kalman filter frequency tracker converges to an optimal estimation with a very low computational complexity only if an exact knowledge about the initial state is available and the model is accurate otherwise it may diverge. On the other hand, particle filter performance is not so sensitive to the initial state estimation and results in a more robust estimation even if no prior knowledge about the initial state is available but at a cost of much more computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm that takes advantages of both extended Kalman and particle filter in order to achieve a robust and fast algorithm for estimating the fundamental frequency of audio signals. Simulation results reveal that this hybrid algorithm is robust, fast and accurate enough for real-time applications</abstract>

        <papertitle>Efficient Mixed Implementation Method for Audio Source Tracking</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>it's known that most of the audio sources tracking techniques are complicated as they require high degree of computations and considerable long real time processing. As a result of this, only certain hardware architectures can meet these application requirements. This work is assessing a previously presented source detection algorithm which meant to be adaptive in real time spectrum searching targeting less workload. The described method in this paper is mixing the good features of high accuracy of Delay and Sum Beamforming (DSB) algorithm and low complexity of the General Cross Correlation (GCC) technique. The requirements and constraints were fairly analyzed to reach an optimal implementation that overcomes efficiently the limitations of the alternatives. The presented results show clearly an identical accuracy performance with faster real time implementation. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Nonintrusive Speech Quality Estimation Based on Perceptual Linear Prediction</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Objective measures of speech quality are attractive because they facilitate performance assessment of hearing aids (HAs) without the need for human listeners. Objective speech quality predictions are usually performed intrusively, wherein the &quot;closeness&quot; be-tween the reference and HA output speech recordings is quantified. In this paper, we focus on nonintrusive estimation of HA speech quality based on Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) modeling approach. In PLP, perceptual phenomena such as non-uniform filter bank analysis and nonlinear mapping between sound intensity and its perceived loudness are incorporated into the linear prediction feature extraction process. In this work, PLP and PLP-based cepstral coefficients were computed from HA speech recordings and their statistical properties were utilized as features for speech quality estimation. A custom database of HA speech recordings obtained in different noisy and reverberant environments was used to investigate the predictive performance of these individual features. In addition, regression functions that linearly combined the features and mapped to the predicted quality scores, were derived and validated. Experimental results show that the proposed PLP-based speech quality estimates correlate well with subjective ratings of speech quality by hearing impaired listeners.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Glimpse of 3D Acoustics for Immersive Communication</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Future multimedia communications systems can be expected to be increasingly immersive, driven by new technology for improving the 3D visual and acoustic experiences. In a classical communications sense this seems a step backwards because a much larger bandwidth is required, but the return is a richer communications mode. Acoustic technology for the audio layer is presented here, although it is not entirely inseparable from the visual aspects. The talker's audio signals are sensed by an array of microphones assisted by a video-based talker-location system. The data is transmitted to the remote listener's location, where the 3D audio is reproduced around the listeners' ears by an array of speakers. The idea is that listener experiences being in the same room as the talkers, but achieving this convincingly has raised challenges which require new research to meet. As a step in this direction, we use simulation in a reverberant environment to investigate the improvement from using prescribed-directivity loudspeakers for the sound field reproduction. The strong performance improvement, compared to using an array of conventional omni-directional loudspeakers contributes motivation for the development of such directional loudspeakers.&#13;

        <papertitle>Efficient Audio Segmentation in Soccer Videos</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Identifying different audio segments in videos is the first step for many important tasks such as event detection and speech transcription. Approaches using Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) perform reasonably well in stationary conditions but do not scale to a broad range of environmental conditions. This paper focuses on the audio segmentation in broadcast soccer videos into audio classes such as Silence, Speech Only, Speech Over Crowd, Crowd Only and Excited, with an alternative feature set which is simplistic as well as robust to changes in the environment conditions. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Neural Networks and Random Forest are used for the classification. The accuracy achieved with SVMs, Neural Networks and Random Forest are 83.80%, 86.07%, and 88.35% respectively. The proposed features and Random Forest classifier are found to achieve better accuracy compared to the other classifiers</abstract>

        <papertitle>3D Mapping and Navigation for Autonomous Quadrotor Aircraft</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>Autonomous navigation is a challenging problem in GPS-denied environments. For small flying robots and quadrotors, inherent limitations such as limited sensor payload and small system time-constant add another layer of challenge to the problem. This paper presents a solution for autonomous navigation of a quadrotor by performing autonomous behaviors, such as exploration, returning home, or following waypoints. The solution relies on accurate localization, mapping, and navigation between waypoints.&#13;
&#13;
A 3D mapping algorithm is proposed that enables the fast moving quadrotor to make a reliable 3D model. One of the contributions of the paper is the 3D mapping algorithm which is built upon a 2D mapping algorithm and IMU information. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed 3D mapping allows the quadrotor to generate more accurate models with low-bandwidth channels. Additionally, the algorithm allows the quadrotor to have aggressive changes in rotation and translation that occur frequently due to the fast dynamics of the quadrotor. Also 2D and 3D maps are displayed on multiple remote devices, such as tablets. Multiple tests were performed in simulated and real-world environments to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Stability Analysis and Trajectory Design of a 2-D.O.F. Bipedal Walker</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper studies a walking 2-DOF robot, which consists of a stance leg, swing leg and a hip mass. Due to the hybrid nature of the robot, a hybrid virtual holonomic constraint (hVHC) to be enforced is constructed. A sufficient condition to the stability of the constraint is proposed. For a desired gait trajectory, the paper presents a systematic procedure on designing a gait profile with per-defined period while enforcing the hVHC at the same time. In addition, necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed that regulates tracking error even at impact events.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Dynamic Image-based Visual Servoing for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Bounded Inputs</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>We present a dynamic image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control law for an quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The controller regulates the relative pose between the vehicle and a planar visual target. The proposed IBVS approach relies on a virtual camera where the image features are defined. The virtual camera has zero roll and pitch motion. Since the image feature error is stabilized in the virtual camera, the visual target potentially leaves the real camera's field of view (FoV). To keep the visual target in the camera FoV, the roll and pitch of the vehicle are bounded to sufficiently small values in the proposed method. At the end, numerical simulation is conducted to demonstrate the controller performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On ASMC Design for Robotic Manipulators</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>The purpose of this paper is to investigate alternative designs to deal with uncertain robotic system dynamics in general. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a recently proposed adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) design with a novel switching gain dynamics, called integral/exponential adaptation law, to a five-link robot manipulator with uncertain dynamics. The proposed design does not require a-priori knowledge of the upper bounds of perturbations. The simulation results show low chatter on control action and better tracking error performances.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper presents a novel low-voltage and low-power CMOS voltage controlled ring oscillator (VCO) for use in portable wireless sensor applications. The frequency is controlled using a MOS voltage controlled capacitor (varactor) to generate a large tuning range between 166 MHz to 600 MHz. The proposed three-stage VCO is designed and simulated in TSMC 65nm technology. It operates by 0.6 V power supply and consumes 151.2 µW.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A 220nA Bandgap Reference With 80dB PSRR Targeting Energy Harvesting</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>For emerging high volume applications such as wireless sensor networks, energy harvesting, or consumer bio-metrics, bandgap voltage references in CMOS may be viewed in a more favorable light by manufacturing due to their low cost, ruggedness, and availability of the predictable parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT). To generate a bandgap voltage (VBG) reference with a near zero temperature coefficient (TC), a BJT's base-emitter voltage (VBE) with a negative TC is added to a gained-up thermal voltage (VT) with a positive TC. However, ultra low power applications prohibit use of conventional bandgaps because of the impractically large passive resistors they require to make their VT's gain factor (g) in VBG = VBE + g.VT. One of the contributions of the proposed reference is to eliminate the large passive resistor in an ultra low power bandgap reference. Batteryless and wireless electronics, in general, may be subject to less orderly power supply patterns. To guard band against jittery supply and disorderly power up patterns, especially in mission critical bioelectronics applications, another contribution of the proposed design is that the positive feedback loop associated with bandgap's amplifier (that is vulnerable to transients) can be eliminated here without deterring overall performance. Ultra low currents are generally accompanied with increased noise. Additional contribution of this bandgap's topology is that its noise is reduced via dominant use of PMOSFETs, with low 1/f noise, in pertinent signal paths. Lastly, the operating currents of the entire bandgap is mostly independent of threshold voltage (VTH) and chiefly a function of mobility, u, that benefits manufacturability and die yield because u is more tightly controllable (compared to poly resistance or VTH, for example). This bandgap consumes about 220 nA of current. Monte carlo (MC) simulations indicates a typical temperature coefficient (TC) of about ±7 ppm ⁄ C over a 100C temperature range, a typical voltage coefficient (VC) of about ± 0.01% ⁄ V, and worst case (WC) power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of about -70dB can be realized with 1.5V &lt; VDD &lt; 2.5V. Die size is roughly 100umX180um in standard 0.18u digital CMOS.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy Harvesting for IoT Sensors Utilizing MEMS Technology</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The growing need for alternative sources to power sensors and portable devices has led to many power-scavenging solutions from ambient energy sources. As the technology scales down and the supply voltage drops, the complexity of power scavenging circuits increases. This paper presents a new transducer circuit utilizing MEMS technology together with a super-diode to convert ambient vibration energy to usable electrical energy efficiently. The proposed circuit can operate with the limited supply voltage of modern technologies. An integrated MEMS actuator containing a switch is used to eliminate the loss of efficiency due to the threshold voltage of diodes that are commonly used to implement electrostatic transducers. A super-diode has also been used to eliminate the need for synchronization while increasing the overall efficiency. Simulation results using Cadence design tools indicate an increased efficiency by more than 27% at one-volt supply voltage compared to the conventional electrostatic transducer.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A 0.4V 90nm CMOS Subthreshold Current Conveyor</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a new low power Current Conveyor II (CCII). The proposed circuit uses a 0.4 V single-ended supply. The advantages of the proposed current mode readout circuit are threefold. Firstly, the proposed circuit provides extremely low power consumption while operating all MOSFETs in the subthreshold region providing highest energy efficiency. Secondly, Self cascode technique is used to increase the gain of the differential amplifier to 65 dB. Finally, it is based on standard CMOS technology which can be easily integrated into VLSI circuits. Near perfect voltage/current tracking up to 1.25/0.8 MHz was achieved while consuming 1.7 µW.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Distributed Generation Long-Term Planning for Voltage Profile Enhancements Using Optimal Hourly Operation Conditions</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>An algorithm to optimize distributed generation allocation in a long-term planning problem to purposely enhance hourly voltage profile is presented. This algorithm deploys an hourly optimal operation to fit the long-term planning problem. It requires the consideration of several operational factors both explicitly or as a byproduct. The complexity level of the problem and the degree of representation of variables (accuracy) necessitated the mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation. Case studies are performed to validate the proposed algorithm. Results confirm the potential benefits of the algorithm especially for distribution utilities interested in knowing the time, type (technology), location and size of DG units that can enhance voltage profile in an operational level.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Effective Input Features Selection For Electricity Price Forecasting</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In forecast modelling, the feature selection techniques are a significant step of data preprocessing prior to creating the prediction model. Selecting the most significant input features is important to increase the prediction accuracy and minimize the data and training time. In this paper, some feature selection techniques are compared and analyzed. Next, the feature selection techniques are used as a filter prior to electricity price forecasting and their influence on prediction accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of each selected subset are compared.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Fault Detection in Power System Using the Hilbert-Huang Transform</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The Hilbert-Huang Transform(HHT) is used for time-frequency analysis of non-stationary and non-linear signals,e.g.,power signals. In this paper, we propose a fault detection method for electric power system using the HHT. The presented numerical example shows the implementation of HHT on unsymmetrical phase voltages to detect the occurrence time of a single line to ground fault at a particular phase in the power system. The HHT is shown to be an effective method for detecting fault due to its ability of estimating the instants at which the frequency of the signal changes abruptly.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Tuning Of Power System Stabilizers By Biogeography Based Optimization Method</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Power system stabilizers (PSS) are used to damp out the low frequency power system oscillations caused by sudden change in the load, loosing of one generator or losing a transmission line. In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm known as biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is used to find the optimal settings of the power system stabilizer (PSS) parameters for a single machine infinite bus system operating at different loading conditions and the results are compared with a conventionally designed power system stabilizer to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper proposes a stochastic gradient-like optimization for experimentally determining parameters to be used in the extended Kalman filter in an in induction motor model. The gradient-like algorithm can be combined with an evolutionary algorithm in order to avoid being trapped in a low-performance local extremum. Recursive methods of computing the gradient is presented.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Airspace Configuration Model using Swarm Intelligence based Graph Partitioning</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper dynamic airspace configuration model based on weighted graphs is proposed. Initially weighted graph is set up to describe given airspace using its structure information and traffic data, weighted. It includes air routes, airports, way points and crossing points in which air routes is represented by edges and others as vertices of the graph. Workload metric is considered as aircraft count and balanced workload indicates equalize aircraft count among the sectors Vertices are used as sites of Voronoi diagram to divide the airspace into cells. Accordingly airspace configuration problem is described as weighted graph partitioning problem with objective as minimization of workload by proper sectorization. To solve the problem, graph partitioning algorithm based multilevel method and discrete particle swarm optimization is used. Simulation results show that the sectors generated by proposed method satisfy workload balancing, minimum distance as well as connectivity constraint. &#13;

        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>We compare state-of-the-art sub-wavelength grating couplers (SWGCs) based on their coupling efficiencies, 1-dB bandwidths and back reflections. Three types of SWGC, the uniform SWGC, the apodized SWGC, and the broadband SWGC, which use one-dimensional sub-wavelength gratings, are compared for the silicon-on-insulator platform. The SWGCs are designed for the fundamental TE mode, operating at 1550nm.&#13;

        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Low-power, high-speed optical interconnects are essential to future high-performance computers and data centers for the cloud. Using CMOS-compatible silicon photonics processes, we have developed integrated photonic devices, such as 80 Gb/s optical modulators with ultralow power consumption at the level of femtojoule per bit and O-band on-chip wavelength multiplexers. These devices are promising for next-generation 400 Gb/s optical interconnects.</abstract>

        <papertitle>REEC: Reliable Multicast in Mobile Wireless Ad Hoc Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Multicasting, which is a one-to-many communication, is motivated by the increasing importance of real-time and multimedia applications with different QoS requirements. This paper presented a non-uniform distributed hash function for wireless ad hoc networks. This function allocates a unique interval to the receiver nodes based on the path weight and the random speed of nodes. This allocation leads to a reduction in the collision of the duplicate multicast packets. This function is used in a multicast weighted tree. The problem of allocating intervals to wireless ad hoc nodes is considered among the NP-Hard problems. Simulation results revealed that the REEC protocol leads to an increase in the rate of packet delivery rate, a decrease in collisions, and a reduction in the average end-to-end delays. Simulation results show that the use of this hash function in the weighted multicast tree leads to 14% decrease in the packet collision rate and 34% increase in the packet delivery rate. It also reduces the average end-to-end delays by 20%.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Hybrid Wireless Ad Hoc Network Design Based On WIFI Technology For Facing Seismic Catastrophes</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis in addition to annual disaster have frequently happened at many places around the world. Disaster monitoring is one of the most challenging application in wireless ad hoc networks as establishing infrastructure based networks are neither feasible nor suitable in that environments. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid wireless ad hoc network design to insure communication means to grasp the information with disaster area, resident's safety and relief goods on the occurrence of disaster. By combining multiple wireless network nodes, a large ad hoc network is organized in the sky on the disaster area and can cover shelters or interrupted communication area as urgent communication means. The system configuration and its function are described. A basic prototype system is constructed to evaluate its function and performance through several disaster applications such as Voice over IP telephone (VoIP), via Internet emergency system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On TDMA Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the problem of finding an efficient schedule for convergecast in a wireless sensor network, using the SINR model of interference, and a TDMA protocol for medium access. We compare two approaches to computing a minimum length schedule for the TDMA frame. In the first approach, called the TC-approach, a multiset of transmission configurations that are interference-free and that cover the convergecast traffic is computed and the scheduling algorithm restricts itself to using these configurations. In the second approach, called the tree-based approach, first a routing tree or subgraph is computed, and next, sets of non-interfering links are scheduled in rounds, based on which links have available traffic in each round. For the TC-based approach, we provide a new column generation approach and several new scheduling heuristics. For the tree-based approach, we propose a new tree construction called the TFM tree, which takes into account variable power assignment, as well as a new scheduling algorithm for the second phase, called the ROS algorithm. We performed extensive experimental evaluations of both approaches. Our results show that the tree-based approach using the TFM tree significantly outperforms the TC-approach.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Bandwidth Aggregation using MPTCP and WMN Gateways</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Wireless Mesh Networks(WMN) usually extend Internet access to unconnected mesh devices by extending the reach of wired access. Typically, in community WiFi networks, the gateway routers see no benefit for providing internet access to the network other than having the capability of reaching other mesh devices. In this paper, we explore a WMN approach where all mesh devices are home gateway router offering full routes to the internet, and having added advantage of maximizing network bandwidth capacity from an ISP base Multipath-TCP implementation. When in operation we deploy TCP to MPTCP proxy and vice versa, in subscriber gateway routers, and in ISP gateway routers. This paper presents solutions for implementing a self-forming IPv4 and IPv6 WMN for same ISP Internet service subscribers. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Random Node Failures and Wireless Networks Connectivity: a Novel Recovery Scheme</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Multi-radio Multi-channel Wireless Networks (M2WNs) have been studied intensively over the past decade with focus on traffic management functionalities such as channel-to-interface assignment, traffic routing and scheduling. These developed solutions always assumed continuous normal operation of all network components while failing to take into consideration the failure-prone nature of wireless networks. In this article, we develop a novel backup scheme to improve the robustness of M2WNs against random failures. Performance evaluation results demonstrate the ability of the scheme to maintain a much higher system throughput compared to traditional failure recovery approaches.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Traffic Scenario Recognition and Analysis for Wireless Cellular System: From Social Network Perspective</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In wireless cellular system, due to the convergence of user behavior, there usually exists some typical scenarios which exhibit different traffic patterns, e.g. stadium, campus and central business district (CBD). Accurate traffic scenario recognition and analysis will lead to more efficient resource management and better QoS (quality-of-service) provision. In this paper, with the idea of social network analysis, a base station social network (BSSN) based method is proposed to recognize and analyze the typical traffic scenarios in wireless cellular system. Firstly, we construct a BSSN to visualize the hidden relationship between base stations (BSs) by using previously measured spatiao-temporal wireless traffic data. Then, a modularity optimization based method is used to discover community structure in BSSN. Analytical results show that each community in BSSN corresponds to a typical wireless scenario with a unique traffic pattern in cellular system. Experimental results illustrate that our proposed BSSN based method is general enough and achieve satisfactory performance in traffic scenario recognition and analysis.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Simulated Annealing based Joint Coverage and Capacity Optimization in LTE</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Self-Organizing Networks (SON) is an advancing technology in wireless communication systems, which employs various algorithms to improve the network performance and reduce the network maintenance cost. The SON is an integral part of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. The SON processing can be centralized, distributed or a hybrid of these two schemes. In this paper, we consider a centralized LTE SON and provide a mechanism to improve both the coverage and capacity of the LTE network by tuning two parameters at each base-station(eNB) - a) transmit power and b) antenna electrical downtilt. Since the process of finding the optimal values for these parameters is highly complex owing to the large solution space, we propose to use the popular machine-learning technique of simulated annealing to solve this problem. We show that our mechanism results in more than 34% increase in network coverage and 21% increase in network capacity when compared to the scheme of using average values for eNB transmit power and antenna electrical downtilt. Also, our simulated annealing based solution is 4dB more power efficient than the aforementioned scheme.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Resource Allocation in OFDM Radio Network Adjacent to Satellite System</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The efficient usage of scarce radio resource is the key factor of wireless networks, however there are some spare radio resource not being used such as the guard band for satellite system. In this paper, to reuse the guard band of satellite system, a new resource allocation scheme consisted of sub-carrier assignment and power allocation is proposed for LTE system to maximize its maximum throughput with negligible interference to satellite system. The implementation algorithm of the proposed scheme is consisted of three modules: the partitions of the possible interference sub-carriers and the impossible interference sub-carriers; the sub-carrier assignment; the power allocation among the possible-interference sub-carriers. There is no sense to allocate the power for the impossible interference sub-carriers because the interference to satellite system is negligible and the maximum power is always the best.</abstract>

        <papertitle>QoE-Aware Downlink User Association in Small Cell Networks via Matching Theory</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The user association is still a key technical challenge in small-cell networks due to significantly difference from traditional macro-cell networks. For avoiding blindness of pursuing higher date rate and achieving the more rational user association, a novel method to associate user to small base station (SBS) based on user quality of experience (QoE) is proposed in this paper. The user-cell association is modeled as the 0-1 integer programming problem in SBS networks, and formulated a matching game formulation for optimal user assignment to address the sum-QoE maximization problem. Furthermore, two kinds of effective cooperative transfer-matching self-optimizing algorithms are designed to explore the stable point of the game. It is proved that the proposed transfer-stable matching algorithm can converge to a stable matching. Moreover, the proposed roulette transfer matching algorithm (RTMA) can find an optimal two-sided transfer. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed schemes and show the improvement for the system effectiveness and QoE fairness.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Intra-MME/S-GW Handover Performance Analysis in Virtualized 3GPP-LTE Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Services providers (SPs) in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems are enduring many challenges in order to accommodate the rapid expansion of mobile data usage. As mobile speed support is expected to reach up to 350 km/hr, handovers (HO) will occur more frequently, thus degrading the system performance in terms of delay. Hence, enhanced HO techniques are essential to support fast and seamless HO. Moreover; virtualization in LTE systems was considered as an integral part of the next generation networking architecture for high mobility communications. The presented framework pertains to the SPs resources dynamic sharing scenario, wherein SPs achieving a different schedulers' policies are sharing evolved Node B. Hybrid HO technique is considered that can enhance the system performance in terms of latency and HO reliability at cell boundary. The average traffic delays have been evaluated to verify the framework's performance effectiveness during and after HO.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Visual Tracking via Bilateral 2DPCA and Robust Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>The success of sparse representation, in face recognition and visual tracking, has attracted much attention in computer vision in spite of its computational complexity. However, these sparse representation-based methods often assume that the coding residual follows either Gaussian or Laplacian distribution, which may not be precise enough to describe the coding residuals in real tracking situations. With the aim of dealing such coding residuals, in this paper, a novel generative tracker is proposed in a Bayesian inference framework by exploiting both the bilateral 2D principle component analysis (B2DPCA) and robust coding. As the coding residual is two-dimensional, the weighted residual minimization is extended and is introduced into B2DPCA reconstruction to avoid the much complex l_1-regularization. Further, it is proposed to use the weights obtained during the process of residual minimization for generating an occlusion matrix, which is used to enhance the tracker updates. The proposed method is evaluated on the challenging image sequences available in the literature, and it is demonstrated that the proposed method performs favorably when compared with the several state-of-the-art methods.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Codebook Design for Vector Quantization using Hexagonal Partitioning</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper proposes an effective training image partitioning technique for vector quantization (VQ) of two-dimensional RGB images. Unlike existing techniques, this method uses hexagonal blocks instead of the traditional rectangular ones, to partition the image. This results in higher image quality and lower perceptual artifacts. Experimentally, for similar compression rates, the use of hexagonal instead of rectangular blocks shows an improvement of 9.08%, 7.61%, 13.18%, and 13.46% in the MSE of the K-means, Linde-Buzo Gray(LBG), Kekre's Fast Codebook Generation(KFCG) and Kekre's Error Vector Rotation Using Walsh sequence(KEVRW) methods, respectively. This however comes at cost of a small increase (2 - 4%) in the computational time.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Head pose estimation and its application in TV viewers' behavior analysis</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Head pose implies a person's visual attention and interest. It plays an important role in many applications. Existing head pose estimation methods work in the original head pose space. However, the large number of head pose candidates in the space makes the estimation task quite challenging. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine head pose estimation method by decomposing the original pose space into a hierarchical structure. The estimation begins by detecting the region of interest (ROI) within a face image via measuring the importance scores of key image points. After that, a coarse head pose estimation step is applied to identify a subset of head pose candidates, based on Gabor filter and random forest. A fine estimation is then employed within the subset, using histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM). Finally, we apply the proposed method to TV viewers' behavior analysis by determining whether a viewer is focused or unfocused, which can be useful for marketing research.&#13;

        <papertitle>A Platform for Subjective Image Quality Evaluation on Mobile Devices</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>From content creators, to content distributors and consumer electronics industry, image quality is an important consideration both from an engineering and artistic point of view. In recent years, with the shift towards mobile multimedia, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to assess the quality of images displayed on mobile devices. In this paper we present an iOS app that makes it easy to perform subjective image quality evaluation on mobile devices. The app implements two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test methodology, and further reduces the cognitive load of subjects performing the test by providing an easy-to-use, natural interface using the mobile device's touch screen. A simple subjective experiment comparing two tone mapping operators for High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the app.&#13;

        <papertitle>Multifocus Image fusion via the Hartley transform</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>The main flaw of Optical lenses, especially for long focal lengths, is their limitation in depth of field (DOF). In other words, objects of an image will not be focused when an image is captured at one distance. Several imaging fusion methods exist. In this paper, the discrete Hartley transform (DHT) is used for fusing the images. The major distinction of the transform with Discrete Fourier transform is that it doesn't have any involvement with complex numbers and it transfers real inputs to real outputs. By implementation of the proposed method, the processed image has a feature of being multi-focused and the different objects of the image have far sharper edges. </abstract>

        <papertitle>An Object Oriented Framework for a Generic Model Predictive Controller</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>We present and object oriented design for a reusable nonlinear model predictive controller framework. The framework balances reusability with flexibility and performance. Separation of interface from implementation simplifies development and facilitates use of dynamic polymorphism to change the controller behaviour at runtime. The work is presented in language agnostic terms, but the success of a particular implementation for an omni-wheeled robot is described briefly. That implementation is available online, but an application non-specific version will be made available with toy examples as starting templates.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Computational Procedures for Robust Nonblocking Supervisory Control</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper an iterative procedure is developed for obtaining the maximally permissive solution for the problem of robust nonblocking supervisory control of discrete-event systems assuming full event observation. In the robust control problem, the plant model belongs to a finite family of discrete-event models, each with its own design specification. It is shown that the procedure developed in this paper converges in a bounded number of steps for finite-state plant models and regular specification languages.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Cascaded Particle Filter for Real-time Tracking using RGB-D Sensor</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a real-time human body tracking system based on cascaded particle filter using Microsoft Kinect. Our tracking is performed in two layers: RGB image-based 2D region body tracking and 1D depth image body extremities tracking. These two layers are combined to represent the basis for full 3D human body tracking by obtaining a probable human body bounding box in 2D while 3D position is obtained by incorporating available depth information. As the first layer, we utilized motion history for tracking a walking person. One particle filter is used to track the 3D bounding box of the person in synchronization with RGB and depth video stream. For this layer, we utilized the expected motion constraints for enhancing the distribution of particle in importance sampling stage. For the second layer within the bounding box, we use depth information to track the extremities. State of the points of extremities is defined and another particle filter is implemented which utilizes a measure using the notion of spin image. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate and compare estimates at any given instances. For example, the initial estimates associated with the tracking of the whole body can be used as a coarse measure for the tracking of the local extremities in case of self-occlusions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Robust adaptive fault estimation for nonlinear particulate process systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>An innovative fault estimation method is proposed for particle size distribution (PSD) processes. The particulate distribution is adopted for fault estimation rather than the system output signal itself. Square root rational B-spline approximation is used to fit the distribution shape. Both Lipschitz nonlinearity and unknown inputs representing modeling uncertainty are considered in the system equation. The proposed fault estimation algorithm guarantees that unknown input decoupling is achieved while the states and the faults are estimated simultaneously. Satisfactory performance has been obtained in a simulation example.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Virtual Memory Architecture to Enhance STT-RAM Performance as Main Memory</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>STT-RAM technology is becoming a popular alternative to both SRAM and DRAM. Several studies have proposed to use hybrid or pure STT-RAM architectures as on-chip caches as well as main memory. The main bulk of research targets improving the power consumption of this new memory technology especially due to the power hungry writes. In this paper we present a method to improve the power consumption of STT-RAM when used as a main memory. Our method introduces a novel page replacement policy that can reduce the number of bit write operations and consequently reduce the overall power consumption. This is done by using a simple hashing algorithm to select the target page with the nearest distance. We use a modified 2.6.32.65 Linux kernel, Gem5 full system simulator and a modified NVMain main memory simulator to evaluate the proposed method. Our implementation was able to achieve up to 54% reduction in power consumption compared to STT-RAM implementations of main memory, and 51% power reduction compared to conventional DRAM implementations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Novel Gate Grading Approach for Soft Error Tolerance in Combinational Circuits</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Continuous shrinkage in the minimum feature size of semiconductor devices and the supply voltage in advanced VLSI logic circuits, has made circuits more susceptible to soft errors. Hence, several fault tolerance techniques have been proposed in the literature to protect combinational circuits against single event transients (SETs). These fault tolerance techniques are mainly based on hardware redundancy and therefore they come at the cost of significant area and power overhead. In this paper, a novel gate grading approach is proposed to prioritize gates based on their influence on the circuit's reliability. Specifically, different masking factors are taken into account and the gates with the lowest masking capabilities are identified so that they can be hardened first. In fact, since the gates with higher priorities affect the circuit's reliability more significantly, protecting them increases the circuit's reliability with the least required area and power overhead.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Centralized Parallel Multi-path Multi-Slot Allocation Approach for TDM NoCs</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The TDM-based NoC is an attractive technique for providing QoS in on-chip communication. However, fast, dynamic and robust path and slot allocation is still a challenging task particularly for networks with high connection request rates. A centralized resource allocation approach is presented in this paper, which enables multipath multislot allocation in parallelism at run-time. With full structured trellis graph that contains the full length stages, the allocation speed is ensured to be very fast. In contrast to previous works, the proposed method features: (1) high allocation speed requiring only two cycles for path searching; (2) improved success rate due to parallel multi-path search.&#13;
&#13;
Experimental results on real hardware models demonstrate two orders of magnitude improvement in allocation speed and ten times higher success rate against previous centralized solutions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Design of Digital Modules for Capacitive Proximity Sensing System Applications</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents the design of an intelligent controlling module as well as the signal processing module for a novel capacitive proximity sensing system for robotic applications. The capacitive sensor is composed of a 4×4 matrix of electrodes. The intelligent controlling module is mapped on an FPGA device embedded in the robotic unit; and is utilized to realize various different sensing arrangements within the same electrode matrix. The signal processing module is realized on an external computer and is used to properly process and classify the results produced by the sensor. By involving these two digital components, a rough estimation of obstacles facing the robot unit carrying the sensor and relative accurate distance information from the obstacle can be obtained.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Novel Hybrid CMOS-Memristor Logic Circuit</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Memristors can be optimally used to implement logic circuits. In this paper, a logic circuit based on Memristor Ratioed Logic (MRL) is proposed. Specifically, a hybrid CMOS-memristive logic family by a suitable combination of 4 memristor and a complementary inverter CMOS structure is presented. The proposed structure by having outputs of AND, OR and XOR gates of inputs at the same time, reducing the area and connections and fewer power consumption can be appropriate for implementation of more complex circuits. Circuit design of a single-bit Full Adder is considered as a case study. The Full Adder proposed is implemented using 10 memristors and 4 transistors comparing to 18 memristors and 8 transistors in the other related work.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Designing and Implementing an Educational Intelligent Motor Control Center (IMCC)</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Higher efficiencies and lower costs are requirements for any industrial plant. Advancements in digital technology and integrated components have made it easier to incorporate device level communications and intelligence into any design. Intelligent motor control is not a new concept; intelligent devices are mature technologies accepted widely throughout industry with well-documented benefits. This paper outlines a less well-documented area: teaching motor control and protection theories through the interactions of a fully integrated, standards-compliant, intelligent motor control center. As well as technical requirements and design specifications for building a state-of-the-art Intelligent Motor Control Center (IMCC). The British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) is an applied educational institute and continuously strives to integrate new and emerging technologies into its curriculum. Once implemented the IMCC will be used as a teaching and applied research platform for students and faculty. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy Saving Opportunities in a 200MMSFD Sweet Gas Plant</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents energy saving opportunities that identified during designing a sweet gas plant. The studied case is a 200 MMSCFD (Million standard cubic feet per day) sweet gas processing plant in the Northeast area of British Columbia, Canada. The study shows how incentive energy rate introduced by BC Hydro made it financially reasonable for the owners to invest in energy efficiency of the plant. Potential energy savings are categorized into process design and electrical design categories. As a result of implementing the Energy Efficient design, the estimated annual energy saving is 21.5 GWh, a decrease of 9.4% of the Base Line plant design. The incremental cost of implementing the energy efficient design approximated at $11 million and a 5.6 year simple payback.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Novel Power Management System For Energy Harvesting in Building Environment</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Nowadays, it can be observed that Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN) are taking increasing vital rolls in many applications such as building energy monitoring and control which is the focus application of the work in this paper. However, the main challenging issue with adopting the WSN technology is the use of power sources with limited life time like batteries. One of the smart solutions that could tackle this problem is using the Energy Harvesting technology. The work in this paper will be focused on harvesting indoor light intensity through proposing of a new power management design. The new approach is inspired by the use of the Fractional Open Circuit Voltage based Maximum Power Point tracking (MPPT) concept for sub mw Photo Voltaic (PV) cells. The new design is adopting two main features: First it minimizes the power consumed by the power management section and second it maximizes the MPPT converted output voltage and consequently improves the efficiency of the power conversion in sub mw power level. The new experimentally tested design showed an improvement of 81 % in the efficiency of MPPT conversion using 0.5 mW input power in comparison with the other presented solutions that showed less efficiency with higher input power. &#13;

        <papertitle>Control Verification via Off-Line Co-Simulation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Power systems are evolving to accommodate more renewable sources of energy, and sophisticated control systems. A characteristic of the evolution is the integration of a communication network overlay that controls the bilateral flow of energy and information. We develop an off-line smart grid co-simulator test-bed from off-the-shelf communication, power and control simulators. The test-bed is targeted as a tool to help researchers verify various communication enabled control schemes designed for distribution system. The benefits of the test-bed are illustrated on a low voltage microgrid system. A test case of an energy management system is evaluated using the off-line co-simulation test-bed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Automatic detection of basal cell carcinoma using vascular-extracted features from dermoscopy images</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. Timely diagnosis of BCC is an important factor in the prognosis of the disease. A key to BCC diagnosis are vascular structures of the lesion. Detection and recognition of cutaneous vasculature provide critical information on diagnosis accuracy and assessment precision. In this paper, we present an effective method to extract vascular information towards lesion diagnosis. Given a dermoscopy image, we first segment vascular structures of the lesion by decomposing the image using independent component analysis into melanin and hemoglobin components and further applying shape filters at different scales. A vessel mask is generated as a result of global thresholding. A set of vascular features are then extracted from the final vessel image of the lesion and fed into a Random Forest classifier. The method demonstrates performance of 94.8% in terms of AUC in differentiating BCC from benign lesions. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Image Processing approach to Generate a Control Signal to Drive an Exoskeleton for Upper Extremity Rehabilitation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper proposes a simple image processing approach for detecting and tracking objects in the surrounding environment purporting to drive a portable exoskeleton for upper extremity rehabilitation. An experiment was carried out to test the feasibility of the proposed approach. The experiment was to mimic reaching an object placed on a ruler board in front of the user in the sagittal plane. Kinematical relations between the object and the user's hand were derived. The output of the image processing approach and the kinematical relations were used to generate a control signal used to drive a portable vision-assisted exoskeleton in a functional rehabilitation tasks. Results of the experimental show that the image processing approach and the kinematic equations are sufficient to drive an exoskeleton in a reaching task.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Implementation of Load-Curve Smoothing Algorithm Based on Battery Energy Storage System</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents the proof of concept for load-curve smoothing using a battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS is exploited to fix the power demand on the supply at a user-defined value while the load changes. A laboratory test bench is set up to validate the concept employing a lithium-ion battery, single-phase inverter, and smart meter. The control algorithm is developed in MATLAB to acquire data from, and send operating commands to, system components by communication through the Modbus protocol. Testing results validate the concept, which can be scaled up to match a variety of system types and sizes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Evaluation of Energetic Efficiency of the Industrial Systems by using Benchmark Energy Factor</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The electro-energetic efficiency of Industrial Systems and Processes (IS&amp;P) is currently monitored by using different types of Energy Performance Indicators (EPI). The EPI represents a ratio between energy spent [kWh] per unit of product, area, volume, or other quantity directly related to production. The EPI values are supposed to be collected in a centralized data system enabling benchmarking activity at national level. One of the major barriers for this process is related to ethical and legal issues impeding disclosure of proprietary information. The tedious normalization process due mainly to volatile and un-reliable reference value is another major barrier for benchmarking process. As a result the accuracy of benchmarking IS&amp;P represents always a challenge for governments and for corporations implementing ISO 50001. The paper proposes a new concept of using of Mathematical Model Benchmarking (MMB). The unitless indicator i.e. Benchmark Energy Factor (BEF) overcomes the current barriers. The paper presents the basics of MMB and basic use of BEF for a case study inspired from real life. The MMB concept can be used by any IS&amp;P owner enabling easy implementation of ISO 50001. BEF indicator enables a reliable rating system model describing energetic efficiency of any IS&amp;P and can be used by Utilities (for their DSM programs), NRCAN or U.S. Department of Energy - Energy-Star Certification for Plants Program replacing existent inefficient benchmarking practice. Canadian Standard Association is currently preparing Guidelines of benchmarking specific IS&amp;P by using MMB concept.&#13;

        <papertitle>Simulation-based investigation of optimal demand-side primary frequency regulation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Many electric power utilities, such as Hydro-Quebec, are capacity limited despite having enormous energy surpluses. When demand and supply fluctuate, frequency control guaranties that the nominal network frequency remains constant.Frequency control can be applied on generation as well as demand side. This paper investigates the application of optimal demand side frequency based load control (OLC) for primary frequency regulation by comparing the performance of OLC and turbine governor action. This kind of comparison may be of interest to power utilities seeking improvement of the efficiency of their power plants. Also presented is a comparative investigation of the effects of choosing different disutility functions on OLC performance with respect to nadir and steady state error. The detailed simulation is performed using SimPowerSystems (SPS) toolbox, in phasor mode, on the IEEE 39-bus New England test system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Implementing Self-Healing Distribution Systems via Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>BC Hydro and Powertech have developed a real-world outdoor integration and interoperability test yard for distributed automation technologies at Powertech Labs referred to as the Smart Utility Test Center (SUTC). The SUTC contains live 25kV power distribution equipment, telecommunications, data collection and management systems interconnected with a commercial Distribution Management System (DMS). FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration) is a Distribution Management System feature to support implementation of self-healing power distribution systems. This presentation will provide an overview of the FLISR as well as the practical aspects of modeling power system networks to support FLISR functions. This paper also discusses how the DMS power system models and FLISR applications are optimized in the SUTC environment to improve the accuracy and performance of self-healing configurations. A sample case study of improvement in SAFI and SAIDI is presented based on an outage simulation with and without self-healing.&#13;

        <papertitle>Voltage Management Challenges in Feeders with High Penetration of Distributed Generation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Interconnection of relatively large independent power producers (IPP) in distribution feeders has created new challenges for the system operators and planners. In this paper, issues pertaining to voltage management in the presence of multiple IPPs and voltage regulators are discussed based on years of utility experiences with high penetration of IPPs. A setpoint-free strategy is proposed for voltage regulators which combines the benefits of the conventional control modes. A reactive power control mode is also proposed for IPPs which ensures no interference in voltage regulation of the feeder when a voltage regulator is present. The proposed control strategies are tested for a variety of load/generation scenarios. </abstract>

        <papertitle>RPsec: Managing Routing Protocol Security</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The Internet routing infrastructure is an obvious target of attack, as compromised routers can be used to stage large scale attacks. While considerable progress has been made on validating the content of routing protocol messages, little use is made of procedures for protecting the path followed by the information exchanged between adjacent routers. When these procedures are used to protect the packets &quot;on the wire&quot;, the necessary parameters are installed manually, and then often left unchanged for five years or more, due to the high cost of making the changes, relative to the cost of the perceived threat. We propose a method for integrating the management of routing protocol security into existing configuration management systems. We outline the design of the data structures that will support automated management of the security relationships among routers, and have constructed YANG models for these data structures. We demonstrate how to manage the distribution of configuration data, using NETCONF and the YANG models. This will facilitate the development of automated key management protocols, which is a necessary first step to achieving higher routing protocol security at a reasonable cost.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Architecture for a Secured Tunnel in the Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) Environment</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>IP multicasting is a communication mechanism in which identical data are communicated from a server to multiple clients. It has two main problems: there is no control over who can receive the multicast data, and every receiver has to be in a network where multicast routing is enabled. Islam and Atwood have shown how to add Receiver Access Control (RAC) to IP multicast. Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) offers a mechanism to enable the clients in a unicast-only region to receive multicast data through an automatically-established tunnel. However, AMT, like the IP multicast that it extends, does not provide any access control over the receivers or any security features. Malla and Atwood have demonstrated how to integrate RAC into the AMT environment, assuming that the AMT tunnel is secure. In this paper, we show how to establish the necessary verifiable identities for the tunnel end points, so that the tunnel can be secured. We also validate the security of our design using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Using Resource Public Key Infrastructure for Secure Border Gateway Protocol</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a widely used Internet routing protocol. While several security features have been introduced and implemented to prevent attacks and address routing instabilities, BGP remains vulnerable due to lack of integrity and authentication of BGP messages. BGP operations strongly depend on its security and attacks on BGP adversely influence packet routing. Given the importance of BGP security, several approaches have been developed to enhance security of BGP sessions. The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), a specialized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), was developed to help secure the Internet routing. It uses cryptographically verifiable statements to ensure that Autonomous Systems (ASes), the Internet resource holders, are certifiably linked to the routing information they generate thus resulting in a reliable routing origin. In this paper, we describe simulation results and a testbed developed for validating route origin.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, collaborative spectrum sensing to detect random signals corrupted by Gaussian noise in the presence of smart attackers is studied. Unlike to the most of related works, we consider a blind attacker detection in which there is no information about the number of attackers and attack strengths. Also, in our proposed scheme, no information about the Primary User (PU) signal and noise is considered to detect the misbehaved Secondary Users (SUs). In addition, the attack strengths can be chosen differently for each attacker. It is proposed to get assistance from some trusted SUs. We obtain a blind detector and then, a detection algorithm using derived detector to detect the attackers is proposed. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed detector, the closed form expressions for detection and false alarm probabilities are computed analytically. The provided closed-form analytical results in addition to simulation results show that the proposed detector outperforms significantly the similar secure spectrum sensing schemes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Machine Learning Techniques for Intrusion Detection on Public Dataset</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The development of computer based systems expands the usage of computer based application in human life. It can be observed that illegal activities such as unauthorized data access, data theft, data modification and various other intrusion activities are rapidly growing during last decade. Hence, deployment and continuous improvement of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are of paramount importance. Intrusion detection techniques are emerged with the time. Presently different soft computing and machine learning methods play a vital role in development of intrusion detection systems. Training, testing and evaluation of IDS with real network traffic is significant challenge, so most of IDS evaluation is based on intrusion data sets. Therefore, analyzing of intrusion data sets are paramount important. In this paper, we evaluated Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Data set (AWID) with different machine learning techniques. Information Gain (IG) and Chi-Squared statistics (CH) feature reduction techniques were applied to evaluate data set performance with feature reduction. Results of experiments show that feature reduction can lead to better data set in terms of accuracy, processing time and complexity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Modeling and Delay Analysis of Wireless HANs in Smart Grids over Fading Channels Subjected to Multiple Access Schemes and Interference</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Smart grids are comprised of several interconnected layers of networks. A set of Electrical Devices (EDs) in the lowest layer, the Home Area Network (HAN), communicates with the Mesh Client (MC). The HAN, in this paper, is modeled as a wireless network using Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) to facilitate communication between the EDs and their respective MCs. For these models, channel capacities over the Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channels are determined and delay analysis is presented. Upper and lower bound expressions for achievable delay, in closed-form, are derived as a function of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), received power, number of EDs, number of channels, and Inter-channel Interference Range (ICR). Numerical simulations have been used to validate the analytical results. It is shown that transmission of packets using TDMA results in a shorter delay than by using FDMA.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Increased Throughput and Reduced Delay with Partially Overlapping Channel in WMNs</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>We instigate the questions of: (i) whether increasing the number of available channels is always useful for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) such as throughput or packet delivering delay, (ii) whether using complex algorithms for employing Partially Overlapping Channels (POCs) is beneficial in terms of improving the QoS of WMNs? For the purpose of the instigation, we design a set of algorithms that can be combined to increase the spatial reuse and to schedule efficiently packet transmissions in WMNs. Extensive numerical experiments indicate that using POCs leads not only to a significant increase in network throughput as reported in previous studies, but also to a considerable decrease in average delay.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal AUV-aided Mobility With Balance Energy Efficient Routing in UWSNs (OAAMBER)</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs), the major challenges are energy efficient data gathering, maximum lifetime of a network, very high energy consumption for data transmission and constant variation in the topology of network. Different techniques of UWSNs are also designed to tackle the above mentioned challenges. The technique we proposed are based on the intelligent mobility of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), AUV select best possible location in the network on the basis of more number of sensor nodes, less residual energy of the sensor nodes in the specific area and limited delivery ratio from specific area. AUV is in continuous coordination with the base station sinks and on the basis of afore mentioned parameters AUV will move to its new position and collects the data from sensor nodes for network lifetime maximization and minimize propagation delay. We will also focus on the intelligent selection of transmission range of sensor nodes on the basis of residual energy of the nodes in order to maximize the network lifetime and stability period of network.</abstract>

        <papertitle>End-to-End Delay Analysis of Wireless Mesh Backbone Network in a Smart Grid</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In smart grids, the critical packets generated by an Electrical Device (ED) at the customer site must be communicated to a control station with minimal delay so that corrective measures, if required, can be initiated quickly at the site. This paper presents the modelling of Wireless Mesh Backbone Network (WMBN) to which customer sites are connected in a smart grid. The WMBN is comprised of Mesh Routers (MRs) that are connected wirelessly to provide an end-to-end path within the network. An analytical model is presented that takes into account Voronoi tessellation for selecting the shortest path for transmissions in this network. Each MR is equipped with a Straight-Line Path Routing (SLPR) algorithm that provides MR traversing packets with a sequence of cells to reach the identified gateway within WMBN. The long link distances between routers are subject to attenuation and communication challenges. An optimum solution to transmit critical packets with minimal delay to the identified gateway is also given. Upper and lower bounds on achievable minimal delay are derived for a Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) mode in terms of: i) signal-to-noise ratio, ii) number of channels, iii) number of hops, iv) distance, v) channel interference, and vi) interference range. Results show that in the worst case critical packets can be delivered to their destinations in less than 4 ms, which meets the standard requirement of a smart grid.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Frequency Domain Analysis for Statistical Assessment of Wind Resources</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, frequency domain analysis with a discrete-time Fourier transform is applied to wind velocity data to study the frequency distribution of wind-regime variability. Seasonal and diurnal trends are identified with a logarithmic-window recursive filtering algorithm and probability density residual analysis. The remaining spectrum is shown to approximate a piecewise linear summation of pink, white and Kolmogorov band-limited noise signals. The largest variance contribution is Kolmogorov turbulence. The spectrum elements are reconstructed into a time-domain signal and analyzed for probability density modeling and envelope detection through Hilbert transform. The magnitude and distribution of wind velocity variance is strongly correlated with the frequency spectrum, indicating frequency domain analysis as a promising method for wind turbine performance modeling and design of hybrid wind power systems. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Underdetermined Joint Blind Source Separation based on Tensor Decomposition</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we propose a simple and effective scheme to jointly estimate the mixing matrices from multiple datasets for the underdetermined case, where the number of sources exceeds that of observations in each dataset. Currently available blind source separation (BSS) methods, including joint blind source separation (JBSS) and underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS), cannot address this underdetermined problem effectively for multiple datasets. We first introduce a novel BSS method, termed as underdetermined joint blind source separation (UJBSS), to estimate the mixing matrices of two datasets. The problem of jointly estimating the mixing matrices is reformulated as canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of a specialized tensor in which a set of spatial covariance matrices are stacked. Furthermore, exploring the dependence information between multiple datasets, we generalize the idea of UJBSS for two datasets to UJBSS for multiple datasets. Numerical results demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed UJBSS method when compared to SOBIUM, a commonly-used single-set UBSS method.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A new Margin-based AdaBoost Algorithm: Even more robust than RobustBoost to class-label noise</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we present a new modification of AdaBoost (Adaptive-Boosting) algorithm that improves its efficiency in presence of class-label noise. The proposed algorithm is significantly more robust against label noise than RobusBoost, the best available and implemented solution. Moreover, unlike RobusBoost, the proposed method does not need optimization toolbox or external parameters provided by user. The empirical results on 9 benchmark datasets showed the proposed method significantly outperforms RobustBoost in terms of classification accuracy and computation time in majority of the examined data sets.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Beating the Zero-Sum Game Using GA to Optimize Technical Financial Market Indicators</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Technical Indicators (TIs) are not only useful tools to analyze and forecast the price of financial security, but also one of the well established applications currently in practice to perform high returns. Traders use TIs to generate trading buy/sell signals. In spite of their practical success, the main problem of a TI is to determine its appropriate parameters which help obtain the most accurate signals and in turn increase returns. The quality of these generated signals depends mainly on each TI's parameters. In this paper, to improve prediction accuracy, we propose a model that integrates the study of financial security historical prices data with TIs. The model employs a Fast Genetic Algorithm technique to optimize and select best parameters combination of four TIs over two proposed fitness functions. An early description of the concept using similar model generation was given in [1]. We depend on this recent work to study gained profit against taken risk.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Active Noise Cancellation: Where Does the Extra Power Go?</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Active noise cancellation (ANC) is a method of reducing an undesired signal, i.e., noise, by introducing an &quot;anti-noise&quot; signals from secondary sources. A fundamental issue for noise cancellation is the destiny of the excess noise power. The noise and the anti-noise sum to create at least twice the power of the original noise, and with the summed power minimized at the site of the cancellation, the excess power must appear elsewhere-often defeating the purpose of the ANC. While ANC is best known for acoustic waves, including vibration control, very similar techniques hold for electromagnetic waves as used in diversity and MIMO communications antennas, electromagnetic cloaking, in many signal processing operations such as equalization, multi-user detection, and polarization cancellers, etc., in communications, sonar and radar, etc. We present here a simple and insightful tour of the cancellation mechanisms of ANC, and the destiny of the excess power generated. For a closed, lossless situation, we demonstrate using a transmission line argument that both the primary noise and secondary anti-noise are reflected back to their own sources, and dissipated in their source impedances.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Position Control of an Offshore Wind Turbine with a Semi-submersible Floating Platform Using the Aerodynamic Force</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents an initial work on position control of a floating offshore wind turbine on a semi-submersible platform. The platform positioning is achieved by adjusting the aerodynamic force of the wind with the manipulation of nacelle yaw and blade pitch angles, without introducing any additional actuator at the platform. At each time instant, a proportional velocity feedback controller compensates the reference tracking error. The nacelle yaw angle and blade pitch angle are set by the feedback controller so that the net force is to achieve the desired velocity correction. The proposed control strategy is validated using a simplified model of a baseline 5MW wind turbine.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Ultrasonic Inspection of Underwater Guy Wires with Applications to Floating Oil Platforms</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents initial work on the development of an Ultrasonic Testing (UT) system to inspect defects in the inner and outer surfaces of underwater guy wires. The methodology involves placing ultrasonic transducers adjacent to simulated sections of guy wire and the analysis of the resultant echo profiles. The goal of this work is to determine if it is feasible to use ultrasonic testing to develop a machine learning based detection system. From the experimental results, we determined that the amplitude and time of arrival (TOA) of the first received wave signals gives a very significant clue to distinguishing the existence of a defect and its severity. Between the amplitude and time of arrival (TOA), the time of arrival (TOA) give a more promising indication since it was affected by the experimental factors in a consistent manner. Therefore, based on these results, we are encouraged to continue to develop ultrasonic techniques to assess underwater guy wires. In this lab scale study, ultrasound transceivers were placed around a physical model of a guy wire and used to develop and record acoustic signals. A MatlabTM based program was developed to do signal processing to extract the position of echo sources from the signal record. Guy wire condition is an important factor in the stability and safety of floating oil and gas platforms. Our final goal in this work is to develop an automatic system to inspect oil and gas floating platform guy wires to improve safety and avoid ecological and financial disasters such as has been witnessed in recent days.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Floating-Body Motion Control by Coupling an Oscillating Mass for Wind Turbine Applications</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents feedback control to suppress the oscillation of an floating offshore wind turbine, by attaching it to a device which can be both an actuator moving a buoyant mass and an electric generator receiving energy from the mass. The feedback controller uses the vertical displacement of the platform to command appropriate forces to the actuator for rejecting unmeasurable wave disturbance forces. With the simplifying assumption of the vertically-moving cylindrical platform and buoyant mass, a state-space model is obtained, and a linear quadratic Gaussian controller is designed based on the model. Simulation results demonstrate not only the efficiency of the proposed control method for mitigating the platform oscillation, but also for its potential benefit to capture wave energy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Classification of Same Arm Movements Using Different Kernels Learning Support Vector Machine</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>&#13;
A robust model is sought for the identification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals including movements of three distinct parts of the user's arm, namely hand, elbow and shoulder. This study investigates the classification performances of the same upper limb motor movements using various kernel functions of the support vector machine (SVM). Polynomial, linear and radial basis (RBF) functions were utilized on a dataset of seven able-bodied individuals. The results obtained showed that the RBF kernel function provided superior classification performance compared with the other kernel functions for these specific tasks. The presented approach is promising for implementing mental task classification, especially for identification of the same upper limb movements.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Double Internal Model Control for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Vector Control System</papertitle>
        <trackname>Control and Robotics</trackname>
        <abstract>Recently, the internal model control (IMC) theory is widely applied to vector control system of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). In this paper, an improved double internal model control (DIMC) is proposed. First, in current loop, although the decoupling is accomplished by the traditional internal model decoupling control (IMDC), there is a trade-off between decoupling effect, response speed and steady state error during the selection of sole adjustable parameter. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the optimal control effect. To address this issue, two current regulatory parameters are introduced in current loop internal model decoupling controller to improve the effect of current decoupling, response speed and steady state error. Second, we propose a simplified method in speed loop two degree of freedom internal model control (2DOF-IMC). The simplified method not only reduces the design step of the controller effectively, but also makes its structure simple. According to the simulation results, the improved algorithm shows promising performance on speed tracking and disturbance rejection. In addition, the performance of current decoupling is improved.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A High-Voltage Driver Based on Stacked Low-Voltage Transistors with Minimized On-Resistance for a Buck Converter in 65 nm CMOS</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a high-voltage (HV) driver for switching a buck converter. The circuit is based on 3-stacked CMOS using gate control circuits to drive maximum current which indicates minimized on-resistance of the HV-driver thus achieving faster switching. The circuit is designed and fabricated using 65 nm CMOS TSMC process technology with a nominal&#13;
voltage of 2.5 V and with a supply voltage of 5.5 V. Since the design is based on stacked CMOS transistors, the circuit is technology-independent. The initial on-resistances of the driver pull-up and the pull-down paths have an improvement of 75% and 36%, respectively. Due to a buck converter switched by the designed HV-driver, output voltages in the range of 0.45 V to 2.45 V can be achieved from different high supply voltages in the range of 3.5 V to 5.5 V. The circuit occupies an area of 0.187 mm².</abstract>

        <papertitle>Design of a High-Voltage Rail-to-Rail Error Amplifier based on Standard CMOS used in an LDO</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents the design of a high-voltage (HV) rail-to-rail error amplifier. This circuit controls the output signal of a low drop-out voltage regulator (LDO) according to the reference voltages and based on stacked standard transistors. The circuit is designed using 65 nm CMOS process technology with a nominal voltage of 2.5 V and is optimized for arbitrary values of supply voltage up to 5.0 V. The error amplifier consists of 3 stages and 2 feedback loops. The stages are internally connected rail-to-rail to achieve high GBW and DC accuracy. The simulation and measurement results for the designed HV-error amplifier show that the output signal of the LDO tracks the reference voltages. The circuit design is technology-independent and compatible with scaled CMOS.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Low Current, 100MHz Bandwidth Envelope Detector for CMOS RFIC PAs</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a low current, 100 MHz bandwidth envelope detector (ED). The targeted functions relate to the need for many on-chip envelope dependent control schemes for improvement of linearity, efficiency, protection circuits, etc. in CMOS-based transceiver and RFIC power amplifiers (PAs). Measurements from an integrated circuit including an envelope detector and an RF amplifier fabricated in CMOS 0.18 um show a detected envelope bandwidth of 110 MHz and a DC power consumption of ~2.3 mW with a 1.8 V supply for operation at 1.9 GHz.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the use of conical helix inductors in wireless power transfer systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>An efficient magnetically coupled wireless power transfer system using a conical coil structure is presented. The use of conical inductors instead of traditional planar coils increases the self-resonance frequency of the transmitter resonator while maintaining the flux linkage to the receiver side. Electromagnetic (EM) and circuit simulation results predict an increase in the efficiency achieved by such wireless power transfer links as compared to systems that use planar inductors. The measurement results of a prototype three-coil structure built based on the conical structure confirm the validity of simulation results.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Moderate Inversion/Saturation Regions As Approximations to &quot;Reconciliation&quot; Model</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The paper proposes analytical definitions of moderate inversion and moderate saturation. These definitions are introduced considering two different series expansions for the function ln2(x). The expansions are &quot;matched&quot;: the upper limit for convergence of the first series and the lower limit for convergence of the second series define the border and transition from weak to moderate inversion/saturation. The moderate inversion/saturation corresponds to approximation of the function ln2(x) by a modified sum of two first terms of the second series. Then, the condition of inversion/saturation is defined by dominance of one term with respect to another. The condition of moderate inversion/saturation is a necessary step in transition from weak to strong inversion/saturation. The introduced definitions correspond to MOS transistor operation physics and eliminate discontinuity in this transition</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Survey on Recent Energy Harvesting Mechanisms</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, a summary of recent advancements in energy harvesting mechanisms is presented. These mechanisms are explained in three sections: electromagnetic, electrostatic, and piezoelectric. The energy density varies from different harvesting techniques where piezoelectric generates the highest, followed by electromagnetic and electrostatic. Piezoelectric and electromagnetic energy harvesters have a low voltage output compared to electrostatic energy harvesters and the maximum output power for electromagnetic, electrostatic, and piezoelectric can be up to 140mW, 50μW, and 12.5mW, respectively. The main drawback of piezoelectric energy harvesters is the price of the material, whereas other energy harvesters are less costly. The advancement on the applications of different energy harvesters can be seen in portable and implemented medical devices. They have a promising future for health monitoring systems and for cardiac implantations. It is expected that these technologies can be used for power generation in large-scale vibration applications such as vehicle suspension, civil structures, railway tracks, and human motion.</abstract>

        <papertitle>PV Harmonic Distribution Analysis for Various Conditions</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Solar sources require using power converters introducing harmonics in the output waveforms. Data used is the solar radiation and temperature in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In this work we studied the effect of changing the blanking angle of the square- wave inverter with 60Hz switching. The harmonics are evaluated for various temperatures and solar radiation for the optimum firing angle. Also probability density function is obtained for this case. The effect of the weather parameters on each harmonic component and on the fundamental are evaluated. Showing the variability in the amplitude of each harmonic component will allow for the determinations of where to put emphasis on the sizing of filtering system. Different loads and their effect on the THD and signal smoothing due to the variable weather conditions are also studied. &#13;

        <papertitle>Application of Dynamic Voltage Restorer for Power Quality Improvement in Induction Furnace</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>During the last few decades, Induction Furnace (IF) is widely preferred in steel industries for melting different types of metal scraps. During its process, it causes a huge disturbance to the nearby consumers as well as utility owing to its non-linear characteristics due to which the power quality gets deteriorated in the power system. This is because of the involvement of high power rectifiers and current source inverters involved in the IF process. There are many power electronics based custom power devices which are used to improve the power quality degradation caused by IF. In this paper, the experimental data has been taken from a steel industry employing IF using power quality analyzer. The simulations have been carried out by using this data and both the experimental and simulation results have been compared. Then, the simulation of Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) has been presented to improve the power quality in IF by harmonic reduction techniques.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Performance Analysis of Boost Converter by Using Different Integration Algorithms</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This work investigated nine popular integration algorithms and simulated the DC-DC boost converters, with and without parasitic elements, operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM). The off-line simulations were performed under the Matlab environment. The methodology consisted of firstly, deriving the state-space model of the converter and then deriving its small-signal average model. The average models were then simulated with the equation solver approach of Matlab. The results from the nine different integration techniques were then compared to validate their accuracy and efficiency. It soon became obvious that the Runge-Kutta 4th order and Trapezoidal techniques could be considered as potential candidates for further work due to their speed, accuracy and stability in the implementation of real-time models in embedded hardware platforms. The best results were obtained with the Runge-Kutta 4th order and Trapezoidal techniques, and these techniques are recommended for the future investigations with the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) environment.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Efficient No-Reference Blurriness Metric for Images and Video frames</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>The objective measurement of blurring artifacts plays an important role in the dynamic monitoring, adjusting image quality, optimizing algorithms and parameter settings in a variety of image and video processing applications. In this paper, we propose a no-reference metric to estimate blurriness distortion. The work addresses the problem that existing no-reference metrics fail to predict the correct amount of blurriness in images and video with varying content. The proposed metric uses a human vision system (HVS) based approach to detect the edges in the images and also uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate the blurriness. The metric performance is demonstrated by comparing with other existing no-reference metrics for two different publicly available data bases. Test results show that proposed metric exhibits a strong correlation with subjective quality scores. </abstract>

        <papertitle>RDO Cost Modeling for Low-Complexity HEVC Intra Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the newest international standard for video compression, providing improved coding performance that achieves compression ratios up to 50% higher than those obtained with H.264/AVC. However, this improvement comes at the expense of high computational complexity and coding time. In this paper, we propose a novel method for fast and low-complexity intra HEVC mode decision based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO) cost modeling, which permits the exclusion of non-promising candidates from the RDO processing. To achieve even more complexity reduction, an additional rough most probable modes examination is coupled with the main algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms reduce the encoding time by 41.8% on average, with a negligible quality loss of 0.058 dB (BD-PSNR) for all-intra scenarios, as compared to the HEVC reference implementation, the HM 15.0.</abstract>

        <papertitle>SAR Image Despeckling Using Vector-Based Hidden Markov Model in Wavelet Domain</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Despecking is an essential part of any synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery system. In this work, we propose a new despeckling method for SAR images in the wavelet domain using statistical models. It is known that the performance of such methods can be significantly improved by taking into account the statistical dependencies between the wavelet coefficients. It has been shown that the vector-based hidden Markov model (HMM) is capable of capturing the subband marginal distribution and the inter-scale, intra-scale and cross orientation dependencies of the wavelet coefficients. In view of this, in order to estimate a specklefree SAR image, a Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator using the vector-based HMM as a prior for the wavelet coefficients of images is developed. Experiments are performed using the real and synthetically-speckled SAR images. The performance of the proposed despeckling method is evaluated and shown to be superior to some of the existing techniques in terms of both providing better preservation of the edges and yielding better visual quality.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Simulation Environment for Visual-Inertial Sensor Fusion</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>The complementary nature of visual- and inertial-based trackers allows for robust hybrid tracking systems capable of handling fast motion and occlusions. We present a tool to investigate the fusion of these two types of modalities, in the form of a simulation environment. The environment generates the ground-truth data of a nine-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) as well as the individual camera frames from an array of cameras. Using the simulation environment, we demonstrate how visual trackers and inertial-based trackers can be benchmarked individually, and then show how the environment can be used to study visual-inertial sensor fusion.&#13;

        <papertitle>Automatic Cleavage Detection in H.264 Sequence of Human Embryo Development</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Automated human embryo assessment/grading techniques need to be developed to enhance In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcome by selecting embryos with highest implantation potentials. Recently, a number of embryo assessment/grading algorithms have been proposed, however, none of these techniques are fully automatic. In addition, they generally suffer from high computational cost, since they perform extensive computational processing in the spatial domain on every single image/frame. Video compressed domain event detection could play a key role in practicalization and automation of human embryo quality assessment. In this work, a human embryo cleavage detection (CD) technique is proposed in compressed H.264 domain. By doing so, the expensive spatial domain processing is directed to where it is most needed. The basic performance of the proposed method is verified using two sequences of human embryo development.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Image Reconstruction from Discrete Orthogonal Racah Moments</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>In this research, a matrix notation method to extract discrete orthogonal Racah moments is proposed to reduce the computation time. To verify this new computational method, the image reconstructions from higher orders of Racah moments are performed. Our experimental results show that the Racah moments computing time has been reduced tremendously, while the testing image can be reconstructed completely by Racah moments of orders up to 510 without any error.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Color Image Denoising using Multivariate Cauchy PDF in the Contourlet Domain</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>A new color image denoising method in the contourlet domain is proposed for reducing noise in images corrupted by the additive white Gaussian noise. This method takes into account the statistical dependencies among the contourlet coefficients of the RGB color channels. In view of this, the multivariate Cauchy distribution is used to capture the inter-channel dependencies of the contourlet coefficients. This model is then exploited in a Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator to restore the clean coefficients by deriving an efficient closed-form shrinkage function. Experimental results are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed denoising method using standard color images contaminated by the simulated noise. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both subjective and objective criteria. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy-efficient and Distributed Data-aware Clustering Protocol for the Internet-of-Things</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new paradigm of wire-&#13;
less technology, where smart sensors and machines communicate&#13;
through amalgamating multivaried protocols and devices such&#13;
as Zigbee, Bluetooth, Radio Frequency Identification (RF ID)&#13;
and Wireless Sensor Network (W SN ). IoT systems, requires&#13;
sensing, gathering, storing, processing and transmitting of data&#13;
from real time sensors as well as virtual online sensors. Thus,&#13;
energy efficiency and data delivery are the key requirements. In&#13;
this paper, we introduce active RFID tags based cluster head&#13;
(CH) selection, data-awareness and energy harvesting in the IoT&#13;
systems, the results show that the IoT based WSN heterogeneous&#13;
systems are better equipped to deal with energy efficiency and&#13;
data delivery problems. Simulation results supports our proposed&#13;
method and shows significant improvement over state-of-the art&#13;
techniques.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Adaptive Granular HARQ LDPC-Based Coding for Secrecy Enhancement in Wiretap Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work, we consider the reliable and secure transmission over generic-Gaussian Wiretap channel model. An Adaptive Granular Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (AG-HARQ) protocol is proposed which tries to minimize the required rate for legitimate parties successful decoding while amplifying the privacy by minimizing the information leakage benefit to the Wiretappers. In the case of failure at the legitimate receiver's output, the retransmission which is controlled by Bob can be requested. In our proposed method, instead of the retransmission of the whole packet or sending the sub-packets at random i.e. the Granular-HARQ (G-HARQ) method, Bob can ask for the specific sub-packets which have the lowest mean LLR regarding other sub-packets. By having these sub-packets, Bob can converge to the right message having fewer requests which means the probability of the information leakage will decrease at the Wiretapper side. The Frame Error Rate (FER) metric is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, even in the case of negative Security Gap (SG) which means the quality of the Wiretapper's channel be better than the main channel. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Analyzing Surveillance Videos using automatically generated processing sequences with Knowledge-Augmented Genetic Algorithms</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Extracting meaningful information from large number of video streams require designing specific algorithms to detect each type of object such as faces, people, vehicles, bags etc. The development of such specific algorithms requires a large amount of time from an expert in image analysis. Optimization based techniques have been increasingly used to automatically develop such algorithms, but they do not utilize any domain knowledge. Consequently, these automated approaches explore a large solution space and were only able to use a small number of primitive tools as building blocks in the generated algorithms. We proposes a novel method which integrates abstract knowledge about image processing tools into a genetic algorithm by exploiting the fact that there are classes of image processing algorithms that implement specific categories of algorithms such as noise reduction, sharpening, edge detection, binarization, classification etc. Using such knowledge, we were able to constrain the search performed by the genetic algorithm within a rich space of possibly successful processing sequences. Moreover, the use of abstract knowledge decouples the proposed method from implementation details of specific processing tools so that the system can be easily extended by incorporating additional tools. Experimental evaluations compare the our approach with a traditional genetic algorithm based implementation which does not utilize highlevel knowledge. A case study shows that the proposed method could converge to the optimum solution six times faster than the traditional method.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Virtualized Allocation Performance Analysis in 5G Two-Tier Cellular Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Enhancement of quality of services (QoS) parameters is a challenging requirement in the Fifth Generation (5G) networks. Delay sensitive applications such as voice over internet protocol, online gaming, and live video are easily affected especially in high data traffic with limited available resources. Moreover; virtualization in standard long term evolution (LTE) systems is considered as an integral promising solution in the next generation networking architecture. In this paper, we aim to enhance the delay performance of such applications by utilizing the extra resources available in two-tier cellular network architecture with macro- and micro-cells. Virtualization is considered by allowing users belonging to the macro-cell to be allocated resources of the micro-cell when located in the micro-cell range. The average delays for various traffic types are evaluated to verify the framework's performance effectiveness before and after resources sharing scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed framework considerably reduces UE's average delay when compared with the non-sharing scheme.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Detection of GPS Spoofing through Signal Multipath Signature Analysis</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Spoofing that emulates authentic signals to coerce target receivers into generating false navigation solutions is a severe threat to Global Positioning System (GPS). In order to forge a reasonable navigation solution, the spoofer generally has to mimic signals of several GPS satellites simultaneously. In view of the fact that GPS signals sourced from a single transmitter would essentially experience an identical wireless channel to a receiver, a GPS spoofing detection scheme is proposed based on comparing the multipath signature of received signals. More specifically, the delay and gain ratio between multiple paths of a wireless channel that cannot be masked by spoofing signals are exploited. The delays between the strongest and other correlation peaks associated with each satellite is first evaluated. The ratio between the strongest peak and a correlation peak with the same delay for different satellites and closest to the strongest peak is then collected. With an identical wireless channel, the ratios corresponding to different satellites would be highly correlated. In contrast, ratios of authentic satellite signals that experience independent channels would be independent of each other. GPS spoofing can therefore be detected. The proposed design has been validated by simulations. </abstract>

        <papertitle>On Determining the Cost-Effective Optical Transport Network Architecture for Next Generation Data Center Interconnectivity</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transport networks based on fixed spectrum grid with Single Line Rate (SLR) wavelengths cannot cope with the exponential growth and heterogeneity of data traffic along with the rapidly growing Data Center Interconnect (DCI) market. Alternatively, higher scalability can be provided by adopting the Mixed Line Rate (MLR) architecture and the so-called Elastic Optical Network (EON) architecture, which is enabled by the use of the Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (O-OFDM) technology. In this paper, we develop heuristics for the design and planning of optical transport networks using the afore-mentioned architecture options. With the use of these heuristics, we compare the total cost of the innovative elastic network with respect to the conventional DWDM ones (SLR and MLR) operating in different reference network models and under different traffic patterns. Our simulation results give an economic insight to equipment vendors and network operators of the cost benefit of the elastic OFDM-based paradigm for the operation of the future-proof data center optical networking. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Attack-Aware RWA Using Knowledge of Demand Holding Times</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In Transparent Optical Networks (TONs), traffic is carried over end-to-end all optical connections, called lightpaths. Due to the increasingly high data rates and the vulnerabilities related to the transparency of optical networks, security issues in transparent wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks have become of great significance to network managers. In this paper, we consider the problem of attack-aware routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) in optical networks, for periodic scheduled traffic demands. We present an optimal mathematical formulation to solve the RWA for scheduled lightpath demands in such a way that the overall vulnerability to attacks is minimized for the set of lightpaths as a whole. Our simulations show that the proposed approach can lead to significant reductions in the attack-radius.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Resource Requirements in Fixed-Grid and Flex-Grid Networks for Dynamic Provisioning of Data Center Traffic</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The seemingly insatiable demand for mobile, video and cloud-based services shows no sign of slowing down. High bandwidth-consuming applications such as super-sized cloud storage and 4K/Ultra High Definition video services are becoming more and more popular. This causes requirements for optical networks to reach transmission of 100 Gbps and beyond. However, going beyond 100 Gbps does not come without challenges. This explosive growth in bandwidth utilization will require optical networks to be more scalable, agile, flexible and cost effective. Current optical technology - Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) seems to become insufficient. The Elastic Optical Networks technology is a next step in the evolution of optical networks. This paper presents the minimum requirements for Wavelength Division Multiplexing and Elastic Optical Networks resources in order to achieve the best trade-off between the network cost and obtaining the various thresholds of Service Level Agreement. We take into consideration forecasted traffic volumes for the next few years. This paper will allow network providers to perform an improved estimation of the required network resources for the next few years.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Shadowing Effects on Visible Light Communication Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>It is well known that the effect of shadowing on a visible light communication (VLC) system is severe due to its line of sight propagation nature. Hence, shadowing can seriously impair the system performance. In this paper, we propose a method to take advantage of the optical diffraction phenomenon to overcome shadowing by employing a receiver with a wide field-of-view (FOV). We have modelled the shadowing effect for visible light by a bimodal distribution and derived the probability of error for low, moderate and severe shadowing conditions. The bimodal distribution effectively represents separate propagation modes caused by different polarizations. This approach is useful in both indoor and outdoor environments.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Theoretical Accuracy Analysis of Indoor Visible Light Communication Positioning System Based on Time-of-Arrival</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, an improved channel model and estimation for positioning in indoor environments using the visible light is presented. For positioning, the specific propagation and indoor channel model for visible light is used and a time-of- arrival (TOA) based distance estimations are proposed for two cases of known and unknown transmitter and receiver vertical distance. Based on this model and also assuming perfect synchronization between transmitter and receiver, the Cramer- Rao lower bound (CRLB) is computed as the theoretical limits on the performance and accuracy of any unbiased estimator. Calculations show that proposed channel model and positioning result to more accurate distance estimate compared to their counterparts and the corresponding CRLB is almost 100 times lower than what was previously supposed</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Smart City Model Implementation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Smart cities are based on the most advanced and reliable sources of technology that guarantees efficiency and provides quality of life. As with time, many cities around the world are resorting to smarter and more intelligent infrastructures in order to provide features that enhance the living standards of civilians and resolve major issues such as energy crises, air pollution, and traffic problems. In this work, we propose the use of the hierarchical control structure to model different features of a smart city which include the parking system, traffic system, smart house, streetlight system, monitoring system and a mosque. These modeled features address the aspects of smart living, smart environment, smart governance and smart mobility in a city.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Using Density Peaks Sentence Clustering For Update Summary Generation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Update summarization is a challenge in automatic text summarization. The task aims to distill evolved messages from a collection of new articles, under the assumption that the reader has already browsed the previous articles. In this paper, we reviewed some state-of-the-art approaches for extracting update summarization and proposed our method called DPC-TS. The method is inspired by the DPC-based multi-documents summarization method, which is put forward in 2015. In our study, we constructed a model using the topic signature algorithm, by which to evaluate the novelty of sentences in update documents set. In addition, we improved the scheme of calculating similarities between sentences and sentence selection approach to make sure there are diversity topics in the summary. DPC-TS update documents summarization method is simple but effective. It is a method can be reproduced and deployed in real environment.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A System for Vehicle Collision and Rollover Detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Traffic accidents negatively affect the lives of human beings. Accidents may result in deaths, severe injuries, and loss of income to the impacted families. Accident detection and prevention is a keystone in improving road safety. In this paper, a system for detecting vehicle collision and rollover is presented. The proposed system includes three key phases. Data acquisition where accelerometer and gyroscope, integrated into MPU-6050 motion sensor are used to acquire 3-axis acceleration forces and rotation angles respectively. The complementary filter is used to enable the use of the gyroscope data on the short term because it is very precise and not susceptible to external forces. On the long term, the accelerometer data is used because it does not drift. An algorithm for acquiring data using sensors, filtering and analyzing data, detecting collision and rollover is developed. Experiments are conducted to test the proposed system. Experiments show promising results.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Parallel Implementation of Image Matching with MPI</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, the performance of parallel computing will be thoroughly discussed in the domain of image matching. The concept of image matching is widely used in the area of security, medical and computer vision which requires comparing two images for similarities. However, depending on the size of the images, it is highly possible that the application computation cannot be handled in a single processor running sequential algorithm. In order to overcome this limitation, parallel computing is introduced through Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. In this project, for the comparison of two images, both images are first converted into grayscale and being compared using the Sum of Square differences (SSD) algorithm. Further, a parallel system with 12 processors was implemented to calculate the SSD algorithm between both images. The performance gain of 12, 8, 4 and 2 processors was compared with the performance gain of a single processor. The comparison results presented a linear relationship between the performance gain and the number of processors used for execution. Hence, it proves the significant benefits from parallelism on SSD applications.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Computer Vision Based Detection and Localization of Potholes in Asphalt Pavement Images</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Asphalt pavement distresses have significant importance in roads and highways. This paper addresses the detection and localization of one of the key pavement distresses, the potholes using computer vision. Different kinds of pothole and non-pothole images from asphalt pavement are considered for experimentation. Considering the appearance-shape based nature of the potholes, Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) features are computed for the input images. Features are trained and classified using Naïve Bayes classifier resulting in labeling of the input as pothole or non-pothole image. To locate the pothole in the detected pothole images, normalized graph cut segmentation scheme is employed. Proposed scheme is tested on a dataset having broad range of pavement images. Experimentation results showed 90 % accuracy for the detection of pothole images and high recall for the localization of pothole in the detected images.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Estimating the Steganographic Capacity of Band-Limited Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Steganographic capacity is the maximum amount of data that can be communicated over a channel before a passive adversary's ability to detect the communication reaches a given threshold. In this work, a closed-form expression for the steganographic capacity of low-probability of detection (LPD) systems is derived for real-world communication channels, i.e., continuous, memoryless, and band-limited, when the adversary uses an optimal energy detector to identify the communication. Our derivation of the steganographic capacity is based on approximations for the true probability density functions when covert communication is taking place and when it is not, and we show that the maximum absolute percentage error between the true and approximate density functions is small under LPD conditions, i.e., low signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we show the results of a case study where we determine the steganographic capacity of a covert-acoustic LPD system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Computer Recognition Based On the Compromising Emanations Fingerprint</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Electromagnetic radiation signals from computer displays can be a computer security risk if the radiation signal is intercepted and reconstructed. In addition to the information displayed by the computer, electromagnetic radiation leaks the information of the computer itself which is more important for some attackers, protectors and security inspection workers. In this paper, we found that electromagnetic radiation signals of computer LCD vary much between different devices and analyzed the reason by checking main circuits of computer LCD. Furthermore, this paper proposed the concept of the emanation fingerprint and used high-order cumulants to extract the features of computer LCD emanation to construct the emanation fingerprint. The proposed fingerprint algorithm (EF algorithm) can realize the individual recognition of computer LCDs automatically and accurately without reconstruction of the display image.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Enhanced Binary Patterns for Electrocardiogram (ECG) Biometrics</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Most, if not all, binary patterns variants consider signals observations separately; hence, binary patterns variants ignore any relationship among observations. In this paper we proposed an algorithm that enhances binary patterns extraction to accommodate for temporal progression changes. The enhanced binary patterns extracts a single feature vector that captures changes occurred to observations over time. This enhancement is crucial in cases where the examined signal is repetitive in nature, such as ECG signal. Enhanced binary patterns were examined for ECG biometric application on ECG database with 1,012 subjects. The enhanced binary patterns achieved an EER of 7.89% in comparison to 12.4% and 12.3% for non-enhanced binary patterns and a state of the art work. We also showed that enhanced binary patterns features are capable to extract discriminative ECG features that improved EER by 15% when compared to time-domain raw samples.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Evaluating Human Recognition using Electrocardiogram Signals: From Rest to Exercise</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Human recognition has been an active research area in the past decade. As the traditional biometrics such as face, fingerprint and iris have been widely deployed around the world, the vulnerability of such systems to falsification and spoofing attacks has been admitted. ECG is related to electrical activities of heart and is among the newer additions to biometric family. In addition to its inherent liveness detection, it is easy to collect. It can be easily captured from fingertips. However, ECG is a time-varying signal. Unlike most of previous works on ECG biometric that are limited to rest condition, we consider the effect of exercise on biometric performance of ECG. We consider the case that enrollment and testing are in different body conditions: rest and exercise. A feature selection is conducted to select features that are less affected by exercise. Selected features are then used for enrolling and testing the biometric system's users. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods in ECG recognition.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Robust Quantization-based Image Watermarking Scheme in the Wavelet-based Contourlet Domain</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Watermarking has attracted much attention in last decade due to its application in copyright protection of digital multimedia. In this paper, a blind watermarking scheme in the wavelet-based contourlet domain using the singular value decomposition technique is proposed. To realize a blind watermarking scheme, quantization-based embedding and extraction procedures are employed. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed watermarking scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs superior to that of some of the existing schemes in terms of imperceptibility of the embedded watermark and providing lower bit error rate value. It is also shown that the proposed watermarking scheme is more robust against various kinds of attacks such as compression, median filtering, scaling and Gaussian noise, than other existing methods. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Modulation Assisted Preprocessing for Non-binary LDPC Decoding with Extended Min-Sum Algorithm</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>We propose a modulation assisted preprocessing scheme to reduce the computational complexity of non-binary LDPC decoding. With the proposed scheme, the received signal is directly mapped onto a truncated symbol vector through table lookup. The mapping table can be built off-line based on the characteristics of the constellation structure. The receiver needs only to calculate and, if necessary, rank the reliability of the symbols in the truncated vectors, which avoids unnecessary reliability calculation and ranking during on-line operation. The complexity analysis shows that the proposed preprocessing scheme leads to much lower computational complexity, in terms of ranking and addition operations, while offering the same error rate performance as conventional EMS preprocessing scheme.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Power Allocation for Massive MU-MIMO Downlink TDD Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper considers a massive multi-user MIMO downlink time-division duplex system where a large number of antennas at the base station serves single-antenna users in the same time-frequency resource. In the downlink channel, we assume that users obtain an efficient information on the channel state, with the aid of pilot sequences transmitted by BS, to decode the data signals. It is assumed that there is a channel reciprocity between the downlink channel and uplink channel in time-division duplex mode. In this case, users first transmit a pilot sequence to BS, then BS estimates the CSI and precode beamforming training sequences for users. Each user uses minimum mean-square error channel estimation to obtain the estimation of the effective channel gains. Then, users receive the data signal from BS in the rest of the channel coherence time. A lower bound on the capacity is derived in the downlink channel to evaluate the especial efficiency when BS employs maximum-ratio transmission precoding. We also propose a new method of power allocation among the pilot sequences and data signals during a length of coherence time of channel in order to maximize the spectral efficiency for a given total energy budget. The benefits of the optimal power allocation method is verified by the results obtained through simulation. It is shown that more data signal power should be used at high signal-to-noise ratios.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Aspects of Antenna Pattern Estimation from Planar Near-Fields</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>For antenna pattern measurements there are well-established procedures for determining the measurement uncertainty for a given pattern types (mainly high or low gain) and measurement configurations [1-2]. The &quot;measurement uncertainly&quot; refers to the peak gain, rather than to the low directivity regions of a pattern, which is seldom addressed, and which remains a challenge to estimate accurately. A very convenient configuration for pattern estimation is to use planar near field sampling. The sampling density of a near field measurement is seldom derived analytically, with measurement criteria being based on experimental observation. This paper is an experimental study of pattern estimation using planar near field samples, including the effect of the sampling density on the far-fields. We use a standard professional-grade planar near field system (NSI-200 V-5x5) on high-gain linearly polarized reflector antenna (10GHz 1.2m (40 wavelength) diameter reflector with an offset primary feed horn, and gain of about 40dB). Our account is from a typical user's viewpoint rather than from a manufacturer's viewpoint. We demonstrate that increasing the sampling density above the manufacturer's recommendation gives different far-field results for the pattern. Because the pattern is a transform of the near field aperture, this suggests that the default sampling density of the near field aperture is under-sampled or that the sampling is inaccurate. There is a grey area in the sampling requirements for the near field region. We also demonstrate that although the accuracy of the peak gain is robust, the accuracy in low directivity parts of the main lobe is suspect. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Diffraction: A Critical Propagation Mechanism</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>With nearly all of our billions of wireless links having no-line-of-sight between the transmitter and receiver, multipath propagation mechanisms, and their accurate modelling, are coming under revitalized scrutiny. This paper reviews diffraction and how it models transmission around blind corners even when there are no supporting surface currents on the corner structure. From the context of defining diffraction as the difference between geometric optics and reality, the basic equations are reviewed and compared to results from numerical experiments (simulations) and physical experiments, to test the theory. The simulations are from a finite-difference time-domain type of approach, which can be expected to work reasonably well, whereas the method of moments, because it uses surface current sources (electric or magnetic), cannot be expected to demonstrate diffraction for many situations. The applications range from radiosity and simulation tools for architectural lighting and animation, to accurate coherent propagation prediction around multiple, canonical baffles.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Novel Method for Power Flow Optimization in Commercial Buildings</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Energy consumption of Commercial Buildings represents around 40 % of the total energy produced in North America. Total installed power of the small dry type transformers (DTT) installed within a typical Large Office Building (LOB) is 1.5 MVA at minimum. Typically DTT are energized 24/7 being loaded at 4%-7% of their rated power, running about 4800-5500 hours/year at efficiency values of 52%-82%. This paper presents the outcomes of a demonstration project that considered 'smart' configurations of DTT as an alternate to existing methods. This project is intended to become one of the enablers of LEED Volume Program for Design and Construction and Program of Operation and Maintenance launched by USA and Canada Green Building Councils (USGBC and CGBC) in 2010/11. The design proposed in this paper is an &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; approach that can change traditional design of power grids in LOB. This work demonstrated that power flow within the LOB grid can be optimized by dynamic reconfiguration of the power grid topology, the static and dynamic loading of the DTTs leading to improvement in DTT performance while reducing the DTT power demand. The LOB smart grid will adapt itself to the optimum power flow with no human intervention. This paper also proposes new concepts of designing (600V/480V/208V/120V) distribution power grid within LOB that will result in reduction of capital costs (Capex), increase operational energy savings and reduce maintenance costs (Opex).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Design and Implementation of a Highly Reconfigurable Microgrid Test Bed Platform</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents the design of a Microgrid test bed platform. The aim of this test bed is to provide a real-time verification and simulation tool for islanded Microgrids. The main characteristics are high architectural flexibility, high reconfigurability of the simulated Microgrid, and low number of inverters required to simulate an islanded Microgrid in hardware. The test bed is composed of a number of unified inverter modules (simulation modules), each simulating one grid participant. Each simulation module consists of a three-phase voltage source inverter, a local controller and a real-time emulation of several generation plants. This approach allows a wide range of studies in Microgrid control and inverter control for Distributed Generation. This paper describes the test bed platform and demonstrates its implementation with four grid participants.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Control of the Power Electronics Interface of a PV Source in a Smart Residential DC Nanogrid</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) shall be a key component of residential nanogrids. In order to control the power flow and manage energy in DC nanogrids, the option of DC bus signaling has been proposed. PV sources are required to present a V-I characteristic with 3 regions of operation: Droop, maximum power and current limited. This paper describes an approach for implementing such requirements in a 2-stage PV interface. Simulation results of a residential DC nanogrid consisting of a PV source, an AC grid interface and a variable load are presented.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Inexact Power Sharing in AC/DC Hybrid Microgrids</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The AC/DC hybrid topology for the future smart grid is a promising configuration that allows integrating the energy resources and modern loads of AC and DC type. Understanding the AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs) operating in islanding mode and its operational philosophy will pave the road towards the future smart grid with a plug-and-play feature. This paper analyzes an operational aspect related to isolated AC/DC hybrid microgrids and that is the problem of inaccurate power sharing. The simulation results reveal that the unequal reactive power sharing in AC microgrids and the inexact active power sharing in DC microgrids will migrate to AC/DC hybrid microgrids. The research outcomes also show that the interlinking converters encounter the same problem of inexact power sharing.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Route Flap Damping Mechanism Modification to Improve BGP Convergence</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the only routing protocol for the internet. This protocol suffers from unstable routes. Two major built-in mechanisms have been designed to work against the impact of these unstable routes. One of them is Route Flap Damping (RFD), which is designed to detect and suppress flapping or insatiable routes. However, most operators have disabled RFD, which has been found to severely penalize sites for being well connected because of the high number of update messages these sites exchange. Given that the current parameter value for RFD is causing a delay by damping some paths for an hour, this paper proposes a new value reuse threshold to help make the mechanism more effective. With the new value, the time required to reuse the stabilize route will decrease. This will help to enable the RFD, which will decrease BGP churn compared to when RFD is turned off.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Classifying Anomalous Events in BGP Datasets</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which enables Internet interconnectivity, is susceptible to various anomalous events that may affect the Internet performance. Understanding the nature of anomalous events (unintentional or malicious) and their effects helps classify future events and improve the Internet robustness. Determining the rate and causes of these anomalous events is important for assessing loss of data and connectivity. BGP update messages contain network reachability information stored in a Routing Information Base (RIB). In this paper, we use datasets of known malicious attacks and a power outage event and employ machine learning algorithms to identify traffic anomalies.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Security Analysis of C-BGP: A Light Alternative to S-BGP</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Credible BGP (C-BGP) is a lightweight alternative to secure BGP. Its main design objective is to address signature verification costs and deployment challenges associated with S-BGP. To this end, C-BGP defines a control layer of trusted ASes that is comprised of major Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the network. In this environment a non-trusted AS has to verify only the signatures of intermediate ASes between itself and the last trusted AS in the AS-PATH. Similarly, the address prefix is validated only if it was not previously validated by a trusted AS. This scheme works very well as long as the trusted ASes are indeed always trustworthy. In this paper we aim to study security impact of malicious trusted AS(es) in the network. We develop original and detailed analytical and simulation models to study the security of C-BGP and demonstrate that it promises very significant savings in terms of computational overhead and acceptable security performance in the presence of malicious ASes in the network.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Privacy Risk Assessment for Web Tracking</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Web tracking raises a privacy issue since users' browsing activities and personal information are collected and revealed to third parties without their consent. In this paper, we present a dynamic privacy scoring model that assesses the risk to users' privacy associated to tracking components. This model is based on two parameters, i.e. the severity and the relative importance of tracking components and their interactions. The contribution of this work is in its user-oriented approach toward users' awareness and control on privacy risk involved when browsing the Web. </abstract>

advantage of memristors and the good scalability, and radiation hardness of spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memories (STT-MRAMs). In this paper, a modified model of the spintronic memristor device is proposed. The model takes into account the read disturbance, and the temperature variation in spintronic memristor-based memory cells. </abstract>

        <abstract>A cellular automata based spiking neuron model has been presented in this paper. The base of this model is inspired from map-based Izhikevich neuron model. Proposed model can be implemented efficiently with low cost arithmetic units. Model behavior and the state transitions are discussed and it is shown that this model can exhibit neuron-like responses. Results are verified by comparing the state transition of the proposed model with other similar neuron models.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Fault Masking Dual Module Redundancy Method for FPGA</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In order to solve the problem of single-event upset (SEU) in static-random access memory (SRAM) based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a Fault Masking Dual Module Redundancy (FMDMR) structure is proposed in this paper. The FMDMR method make use of AND/OR logic as dual-module redundancy (DMR) voter. The AND/OR logic are built with unoccupied carry-chains in FPGA; hence no additional hardware overhead are brought about by the insertion of voters. Experiments on MCNC'91 benchmarks show that the FMDMR method can reduce 70% SEU faults on average, with a 2x hardware overhead. It balances between area and reliability, and fits for applications with no rigorous require for reliability.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The use of embedded DAS for electronic signal measurements</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) are mainly used with transducers to gather changing parameters such as temperature, pressure, velocity, etc. The transducer will convert each parameter to small varying electrical signal which is then sampled and digitized by the DAS before it passes it to the host computer where it is going to be analyzed and or stored. This paper discusses how embedded DAS can be used for measurement and generation of electronics signals, mainly for the purpose of experimenting. We will develop a prototype of embedded DAS that can generate and measure waveforms that are commonly used in the electronics field.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper concerns with designing a wearable system for prosopagnosia rehabilitation. The system performs a real-time face recognition that runs on an autonomous embedded platform built on an eyewear. The prototype involves a single system-on-module such as Raspberry Pi Compute Module and Raspberry Pi Camera attached via a custom designed PCB where the uHDMI, power supply input, camera module input, microUSB and composite video output are implemented using a custom designed I/O board. The facial recognition application performance is comparable to the identical one based on the OpenCV for PC.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) Modes for 2-D Beam-Steering of Circular Arrays</papertitle>
        <trackname>Devices, Circuits, and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In the context of increasing the data-transmission capacity of next-generation wireless links using multi-input multi-output (MIMO) techniques involving antenna arrays, the concept of so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) states or modes has attracted considerable attention. It is a concept borrowed from physics and optics, applied to much longer RF wavelengths, with the inevitable consequences of generally larger physical dimensions, so that the MIMO capacity is not achieved in a line of sight exceeding the Rayleigh distance from the antenna. However, it is recognized that OAM modes are readily generated by circular arrays with linear phase excitations, and are really the axial patterns of what were known as phase-modes used for steering beams or nulls of circular arrays in the azimuth dimension in past applications. Here the phase-modes of a circular array are used to steer its beam in both the azimuth and elevation dimensions, using 3 or 4 phase-shifters and 3 simple hybrids for an arbitrary number of array elements. The beam-steering is effected in the far field, in polar coordinates all around the array axis, and radially over 1 or 2 beam-widths. The radial range can be extended by combining higher-order phase-modes. Such OAM-based beam-steering means are particularly suited to backhaul links for small cells using mm-wave antennas in future 5G wireless networks. Because RF phase-shifters are expensive and do not scale well at millimeter wavelengths, their numbers must be minimized to fit them in the antenna structure and to keep down costs. The steering range is adequate to compensate for motion of small-cell mounting platforms which are typically non-rigid street fixtures such as sign- and lamp-posts.&#13;

        <abstract>The AURORA Connected Vehicle Technology Testbed is currently being developed at the University of British Columbia with support from Transport Canada and the Asia- Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative and various other government and private sector organizations and in association with the ACTIVE Connected Vehicle Testbed at the University of Alberta. AURORA's mission is to provide Canadian researchers, developers, manufacturers and policymakers engaged in the application, deployment and advancement of connected vehicle technology with access to the testbed infrastructure required to conduct training, demonstrations, pilot projects and research. AURORA will be a national resource that accommodates a broad range of deployment scenarios across a variety of physical environments while fostering a cooperative interdisciplinary environment. AURORA has adopted a formal governance structure that includes a management committee, configuration control board and research collaboration advisory board in order to ensure the maximum return on this substantial infrastructure investment.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Addressing Key Challenges in Transportation Mode Electrification</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Vehicle electrification offers a tremendous potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in transportation in BC, which account for 24% of total provincial emissions. Battery and drivetrain developments have enabled personal electric vehicles (EVs) to start to penetrate the market, but there remain large opportunities in other parts of the transportation sector. The program of research described in this paper is directed toward exploring these additional opportunities. Bus fleets, and other commercial fleets, present unique challenges and opportunities compared to personal EVs and are being explored in concert with fleet operators. E-bikes enable personal mobility and may also afford health co-benefits that can offer overall financial benefits useful in shaping policy. Comparison between battery-electric and fuel-cell electrified drivetrains is also important to understand the overall round-trip and life-cycle relative efficiencies. These studies are all embedded in a number of modeling frameworks that enable studies of grid-interactions of the vehicles with the grid, in particular taking into account temporally and spatially varying GHG intensities, inter-jurisdictional trading, stochastic planning and operation, and demand response (DR) opportunities. The research is ongoing, so the current paper highlights expected impacts and contributions of the various lines of investigation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Baseline Load Forecasting Using a Bayesian Approach</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Independent system operators (ISOs) and utilities have begun to realize the benefits of relying on demand response (DR) for service procurement. However, an aggregating entity in the command and contracting architecture should be included to provide the ISO flexibility in scheduling units. Demand baseline establishment is one of the top initiatives in DR programs. Real-time updating techniques that account for uncertainty are thus highly needed to address baseline forecasting. In this paper, a Bayesian model is proposed to predict the load baseline and it is formulated in a recursive Bayesian framework. The simulation has been performed on two test cases to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the benefits of implementing an online learning algorithm for baseline analysis to improve aggregators' risk averse bidding strategy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>INS/GPS Localization for Reliable Cooperative Driving</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>Cooperative driving improves vehicle safety and the driving experience by promptly adapting the vehicle performance to the surrounding traffic. Communication of accurate and timely information obtained from multiple invehicle sensors, other vehicles and nearby infrastructure is essential to guarantee the robustness and reliable performance of the cooperative driving system. In a multivehicle cooperative network, the host and neighboring vehicles can share their location, intention, and other traffic information using the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology. Similar to the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), cooperative driving applications rely on this information to alert the driver to any potential problems or activate an autonomous feature of the vehicle such as automatic braking, steering or both to avoid or at least alleviate the danger. However, processing the information in cooperative systems is significantly more challenging than ADAS because of the volume of the information, interaction of the vehicles, and increased sensitivity to reliable information due to potential liabilities and legal issues. In this research, we tackle the challenges associated with the reliability and accuracy of the vehicle position, velocity and attitude vector by inertial navigation system (INS)/global positioning system (GPS) fusion, resolving common GPS problems such as blockage and multipath. The future trajectory of each surrounding vehicle is derived using the vehicle position, velocity, acceleration and attitude vector. Subsequently, the direct collision risk level for the host vehicle and surrounding vehicles is calculated using a fuzzy rule-based inference system, and a safe trajectory over a finite horizon for the host vehicle is recalculated.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Practical Hybrid Precoding for Multi-user Massive MIMO Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Massive MIMO systems bring manifold improvements in the system spectral efficiency but result in high hardware and processing complexity at the base station. Employing hybrid precoding at the base station can reduce such complexity. This paper proposes two hybrid precoding schemes for a multi-user massive MIMO system. The proposed schemes, namely sequential-EGT and best-user EGT schemes, use equal gain transmission (EGT) based analog beamforming to reap the diversity benefit of an analog phased-array and employ zero-forcing beamforming for nullifying inter-user interference. As illustrated by the simulation results presented in this paper, the best-user EGT scheme outperforms sequential-EGT scheme in all scenarios with slightly higher computational complexity. We also investigate the optimal number of scheduled users for each scheme.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the degrees of freedom region of the MxN Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, the K-user Gaussian MIMO interference channel is considered. The asymmetric DoF region for the channel is studied. The asymmetric DoF is the case when users have different number of DoF. Two cases are presented, the first is when all transmitters and receivers have equal number of antennas $M$, the other is when each transmitter has $M$ antennas, while each receiver has $N$ antennas. It is assumed that the channel coefficients are constant and known to all transmitters and receivers. The region of the achievable DoF tuple $(d_1; d_2;.... ;d_K)$ is presented.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Beamforming for MIMO Cognitive Radio with Single Primary and Multiple Secondary Users</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Beamforming for a cognitive radio with a primary user with multiple secondary is presented which strives to create an interference-free environment for the primary user. The objective is to maximize the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for the primary user through the transmit beamformers of all users and the receive beamformer of the primary user. Finding the maximum achievable SINR corresponds to constrained maximization of the largest eigenvalue of a Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix. This problem is not a convex optimization; however, the upper bound, derived from the interference-free case is known. Evolutionary algorithms can solve it. In maximum achievable SINR, the secondary users do not have beamformers at their multi-antenna receivers but instead use quasi-maximum-likelihood detection based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The prioritized weighted mean-square-error (PWMSE) solution is also presented. The bit error rate of the primary user outperforms for the maximum achievable SINR compared to PWMSE. The main advantages of the maximum achievable SINR is its lower feedback rate compared to PWMSE because it requires partial channel knowledge.</abstract>

        <papertitle>N-Process Stop and Wait for MIMO Systems with Transmit Antenna Assignment</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we propose N-process stop and wait (N-SAW) with static and dynamic SAW process to transmit antenna assignment for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. In static assignment a SAW process is always assigned to the same transmit antenna, while in dynamic assignment the number of packet retransmissions and the state of the transmit antenna is taken into account. Numerical results show remarkable performance improvement when compared to traditional N-SAW.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Design of Simple Array Antennas for High Directivity</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The antenna is usually the critical component in systems for sensing and communications. This is because the quality of the system, often expressed as some form of signal-to-noise ratio, is usually dominated by the antenna's gain to the desired signal and its suppression of unwanted signals. For increasing its gain (and suppression capability), an antenna requires an increasing electrical aperture. The far-field pattern and the aperture excitation are a transform pair and so a product's pattern requirement dictates the best aperture shape. Many applications simply call for a fixed, high gain, and for the highest directional gain at the aperture's broadside, the aperture should be uniformly illuminated. The problem is now how to excite the aperture with low cost. This paper develops design guidelines for making a simple array antenna with high gain and single feed. It comprises a conducting rectangular cavity with a coaxial feed (although many other feed types are possible), and radiating slots that act to sample the desired uniform aperture illumination. These new design guidelines stem from maximizing the bandwidth and the directivity (gain) for the fixed aperture size. The result is a design for a low-cost, state-of-the-art fixed pattern array, for a range of different sized flat apertures.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Profiling Tool for Exploiting use of Packed Objects in Java Programs</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Packed objects are an experimental feature in the IBM J9 Virtual Machine. Packed objects can be used to gain greater control over the layout of objects in memory and greater flexibility of memory structures that are not in Java code, to reduce the amount of memory required to store objects, and to increase the efficiency of caching. If the application is accessing a significant amount of native data using JNI method calls, then the use of packed objects will eliminate marshalling/unmarshalling of native data into Java objects and thus eliminate redundant data copying. The purpose of developing this profiling tool is to assist software developers in determining how much memory can be saved if they switch to packed objects from standard Java objects. The correctness and usefulness of the profiling tool is evaluated by running several test programs. Based on the results, the programs were modified to use packed objects instead of standard Java objects and the reduction in memory consumption was measured.&#13;

        <papertitle>Object Layout Optimization in the JVM Based on Affinity</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Improving spatial locality has a great impact on improving cache performance by reducing the number of cache misses. Object model optimization is one way to improve the locality of references inside particular objects. This paper extends the object layout optimization study by focusing on the internal layout of Java objects in applications running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In this research, the IBM JVM is modified to be able to organize fields inside Java objects based on their access frequency and access order. Our results show reductions in the number of cache misses in the 20% range and an almost 40% speed up in some benchmarks.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Write Improvement Strategies for Serial NOR Dataflash Memory</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Embedded systems are ubiquitous and perform tasks such as data logging and monitoring. For these devices, lifetime, power use, and data consistency are critical. Systems require robust and energy efficient storage strategies. Serial NOR Dataflash is commonly used, but suffers from high write and erase times as well as limited lifetime. This work proposes write strategies for serial NOR Dataflash that improves efficiency and power use, and decreases write times. Experimental results demonstrate that using masked overwriting strategies can improve write times by an order of magnitude and reduce the number of required page erases, reduce energy consumed by writing and reduce data transfers by up to 90% for specific applications.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Effects of False Sharing and Locality on Object Layout Optimization for Multi-Threaded Applications</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>One approach to decrease the gap between memory latency and processor speed is improving locality of data. Data layout optimization is a way to increase locality by reordering data elements in memory. Unfortunately, for multi-threaded applications, the issue is more complex due to the effects of false sharing. In this paper, the effect of locality and false sharing on multi-threaded applications is investigated. Therefore, fields are reordered inside Java objects in such a way that improves the locality of reference among them and also decreases the estimated probability of false sharing. Considering the role of the JVM in laying out Java objects fields, IBM's JVM is modified with the ability to reorganize fields based on the profiled information.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Thread-Group Based Local Heap Garbage Collection in a Simulated Runtime Environment</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper shows the implementation and the results of a thread-group based generational garbage collector using a simulated environment. The research was done using a simulator developed by Nasartschuk et al. The simulator isolates the garbage collector from other components in a virtual machine to permit in-depth analysis and evaluation of new GC techniques. Contrary to other implementations, this approach assigns a heap to each thread, instead of dividing the heap into several regions for every thread. Furthermore, thread groups are assigned so that the simulator does not always have to stop the world to GC specific regions. This technique has shown an improvement in terms of average GC times over more traditional techniques in many applications. This prototype could be implemented in any environment that uses automated memory management, e.g. in a Java Virtual Machine.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Classification of Electromagnetic signals obtained from microwave scattering over healthy and tumorous breast models</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Current breast cancer screening using mammography has a number of drawbacks. These include the use of ionising radiation, the need for breast compression, high cost and the difficulty in implementing this technology in rural communities. As a result, the feasibility of a portable breast microwave sensing system is being evaluated. One approach would be to automatically classify the presence of breast cancer by analysing the microwave backscatter signals from the breast. This paper shows the results of work carried out to classify 2D breast models into those containing a tumor and those without.&#13;
&#13;
Two different datasets were used. The first was composed of signals generated using a frequency-domain simulation of microwave scattering from breast models made up of skin, fatty tissue and tumours but containing no fibro-glandular tissue. The second dataset was based on models that included fibro-glandular patches of different sizes to produce breasts with densities that range from 0 to 25% in terms of fibro-glandular content. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbours (KNN) machine learning algorithms were used to classify the data.&#13;
&#13;
The SVM classification for the presence of tumors in the homogeneous dataset was correct 94% of the time, while the KNN classification was only accurate 73% of the time. For the second data set the SVM classification was correct 62% of the time, while the KNN classification showed a small improvement.&#13;
&#13;
Further improvements on classification features are necessary to adapt the proposed approach to clinical practice. To this extent, the use of time-domain information arising from both breasts in the classification process will be considered in the future.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The application of Supervised Learning through Feed-forward Neural Networks for ECG signal classification</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper introduces the use of ECG signals from multiple leads to improve the accuracy of ECG signal classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The current methods commonly proposed rely on advanced signal processing or statistical analysis of the main lead II (MLII) in order to extract features that serve as a description of the signal. MLII, while being the most easily obtained ECG signal, does not contain a complete description of the electrical activity of the heart. Therefore, we propose to include a precordial lead, V1, from the Standard 12-Lead ECG system, to give the neural network a 3D view of the electrical patterns that arise during heart activation. This method was shown to be 99.5% accurate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Human Blastocyst Segmentation using Neural Network</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, a new method to segment the blastocyst images in JPEG compressed domain is proposed. In addition to avoiding the unnecessary step of decoding input JPEG images, we exploit valuable features of a DCT transform to automate the segmentation process. A two layer feedforward backpropagation neural network is trained using the derived features of DCT coefficients of JPEG images to learn the characteristics of blastocyst different components. The precision value for the identification of ZP, TE and ICM detection are 0.8, 0.7 and 0.6, while the recall values are 0.8, 0.8 and 0.7, respectively.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Modified Maximum Time Difference Intracardiac Conduction Velocity Estimation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>The cardiac conduction velocity vector (VV) at a desired point in any chamber of the heart can be estimated by processing the local intracardiac electrograms, i.e., the activation times (ATs) and the locations of the recording catheter's electrodes can be used for the VV estimation. In this paper, we modify the maximum time difference (MTD) method, which is a simple computational efficient cardiac VV estimation approach. In the MTD, first, the ATs of the electrograms are extracted, and the corresponding wavefronts are estimated. For each wavefront, the VV is estimated as the vector connecting the first to the last activated electrodes of the catheter divided by the time duration between the activation of those two electrodes. In the proposed modified MTD (MMTD) approach, which is slightly more computationally complex than the MTD, we divide the ATs of each considered wavefront into two groups, such that one group contains the electrodes with early activations, and the other contains those with late activations. We properly assign a time value and a location value to these groups and follow the same procedure as the MTD method to estimate the VV using the assigned values. Using synthetic data, we show that the proposed MMTD improves the quality of the cardiac conduction VV estimation of the MTD method, i.e., the MMTD is more robust to the AT estimation error and is able to determine the VV of the planar wavefronts more accurately.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Parametric Characterization of Stride Dynamics in Patients with Parkinson's Disease Using Entropy Measures</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Gait cadence disturbances due to altered strides indicate the degenerative mobility regulation of motor neurons affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). The approximate entropy (ApEn) and symbolic entropy (SyEn) parameters were used to characterize the stride fluctuations of PD patients. Generalized linear regression analysis (GLRA) technique was applied to perform the pattern classification. Classification performance of GLRA was evaluated in terms of overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Our experimental results indicated that the ApEn and SyEn parameters of PD patients were both significantly larger (Wilcoxon rank-sum test p &lt; 0.01) than those of healthy control subjects. With the ApEn and SyEn features, the GLRA can provide an accurate rate of 82.76% and MCC of 0.6552, along with the area of 0.9037 (sensitivity: 0.8276, specificity: 0.8276) under the ROC curve.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Mid-Term Electricity Price Forecasting Using SVM</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract> In the modern electricity market, its&#13;
very significant to have a precise electricity price&#13;
forecasting in medium term time horizon. They&#13;
are few studies done concentrating on the medium&#13;
term forecasting of the electricity price. Medium&#13;
term time horizon of electricity price forecasting is&#13;
very useful and of great importance, it has many&#13;
applications such as future maintenance scheduling&#13;
of the power plants, risk management, plan future&#13;
contracts, purchasing raw materials and determine&#13;
the market pricing. To forecast the electricity price,&#13;
some factors are very important, such as choosing&#13;
the most useful price features that influence the&#13;
market price, and choosing the proper prediction&#13;
model that is able to predict the price variations&#13;
behavior using the historical data. The proposed&#13;
SVM method and the other employed methods are&#13;
evaluated using the data from the New England&#13;
ISO which are published at their official website</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper proposes a group of Evolutionary Algorithms: Black Hole (BH) algorithm, Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms to solve the economic dispatch problem incorporating the wind energy (EDIW) uncertainty. The proposed methods have a simple procedure to find a near optimal solution for the non-smooth and non-convex problems. There are many constraints in the economic dispatch problem such as generators capacity, ramp rate limit, and prohibited operation zones. There is also the problem of valve point effect which will change the fuel cost equation of the generators, which categorize it as non-smooth and non-convex problem. In this paper, BH, BBO and DE are employed to solve the EDIW problem for three and six generator system. Results of the three algorithms will be compared with other used algorithms.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Novel Approach in Household Electricity Consumption Forecasting</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we find a comprehensive model to&#13;
forecast the energy consumption of the bulk energy consumers.&#13;
The behavior of the bulk energy consumers is different and&#13;
consumers has their own consumption patterns; therefore, we&#13;
segment the bulk energy consumers into two clusters: low-&#13;
consumption and high- consumption, and then make individual&#13;
predictive models for each segment. We use Box and Jenkins&#13;
and the regression model to make model to forecast energy&#13;
consumption. We use the time series to forecast energy usage and&#13;
as a novel method, we use the result of time series and weather&#13;
data to make a regression model. Our results show the error&#13;
decreases and forecasting period extends. We use the Akaike&#13;
Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection among a finite&#13;
set of models.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multi-Area Security-Constrained Unit Commitment and Reserve Allocation with Wind Generators</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>While keeping the formulation simple and, using&#13;
mixed integer Quadratic programming (MIQP), this paper proposes&#13;
a methodology to optimally schedule generating units while&#13;
simultaneously determining the geographical allocation of the&#13;
required reserve. We consider an interconnected power system&#13;
with generation mix participating in a deregulated multi-area&#13;
day-ahead market (DAM) with tie-lines interconnecting areas. A&#13;
realistic evaluation of risk due to wind forecast errors is focused&#13;
on the implementation of the expected energy not served (EENS)&#13;
from wind electric generators (WEGs) as a reliability measure.&#13;
This hourly EENS is scaled by a factor β such that the operator&#13;
has control on the generation system reliability. This study aims&#13;
at the identification of promising system adaptations that lead to&#13;
an improved wind power penetration to grid and a more efficient&#13;
power system operation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Linear Quadratic Regulator design for Power System Stabilizer using Biogeography Based Optimization Method</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper deals with the application of biogeography based optimization algorithm to optimize the state weighting matrix (Q) and the control weighting matrix (R) of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) which presents a new optimal control method (BBO-LQR). The method was used to find the optimal design of the power system stabilizer (PSS) for a single machine infinite bus system operating at different loading conditions. Then (BBO-LQR) results are compared with a conventionally designed power system stabilizer (CPSS) and the normal (trial and error method for obtaining the weighting matrices) optimal power system stabilizer (OPSS) to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Instability Incident During Remote Independent Power Producer Commissioning in BC Hydro System and Corrective Actions to Enhance System Stability</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In British Columbia, there are generating stations including independent power producers that are located in remote areas with low population density. Interconnection of such remote generating stations may result in transient and small-signal instability due to long radial lines and weak inter-connections. In this paper, a small signal instability incident during the synchronization of a remote independent power producer to the BC Hydro system has been reported and analyzed. The stability analysis has been conducted to identify the nature of instabilities and to develop corrective actions for enhancing the system stability. Herein, small- and large-signal transient stability evaluations of the power system have been presented using PSS/E software package.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A novel approach for instability detection based on wide-area measurements and new predictors</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper proposes a novel approach based on the center of power applied on a sliding window for predicting real-time network instability. Syncrophasor measurements obtained from phasor measurements units (PMUs) located at strategic buses on the network are used. For instability assessment, new indices based on bus voltage and current phasors provided from PMUs, bus active power, generator electrical power, angle and speed of the rotor are defined. The instability detection is obtained using an algorithm based on random forests. Two study cases are carried out on the IEEE 4 generators 10 buses and Australian 14 generators to validate the performance of the proposed method.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Independent Component Analysis for Feature Reduction in Critical Clearing Time Estimation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Critical clearing time (CCT) is an important parameter used in transient stability assessment of power systems. In this paper, only pre-fault generator voltage magnitudes and active powers are used as inputs to a multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN) trained using Gauss-Newton approximation for Bayesian regularization to estimate the CCT in an optimal power flow framework. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are utilized to reduce the dimension of these features. Simulations performed on the New England 10-machine 39-bus system show that ICA outperforms PCA and gives a smooth degradation of MFNN performance as the number of input features are reduced.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multi-Contingency Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow using Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Transient stability-constrained optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) aims at optimising the scheduling of generation with stability constraints to ensure a secure system in the event of contingencies. This paper proposes a new approach based on a critical clearing time (CCT) constraint that replaces the dynamic and transient stability constraints of the TSC-OPF problem. The CCT is computed by a multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN) trained using Gauss-Newton approximation for Bayesian regularization. A Sobol quasi-random sequence is adopted for data generation used to train the neural networks to ensure a uniform distribution of generated points in the input space. The method has the merit of removing the computational burden of dynamic simulation during optimisation. Multi-contingency can simply be handled by adding a CCT constraint for each contingency. Simulation results for the New England 10-machine 39-bus system show that TSC-OPF using MFNN has very fast convergence to optimal operating points with the desired CCT.</abstract>

        <papertitle>CF Technique with CPM Mappers in OFDM Systems for Reduction of PAPR</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>An OFDM system with CPM mappers is considered. Such a system in general is known to enhance bit error rate performance by virtue of the memory introduced by the CPM mapper compared to OFDM systems with conventional memoryless mappers such as BPSK and QPSK. In this paper, the ability of CPM mappers in an OFDM system to reduce Peak-to- Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is examined as a function of modulation parameters of mappers used in the system. Various subclasses of CPM mapper such as single-h CPFSK, multi- h CPFSK, and asymmetric multi-h CPFSK are considered to reduce PAPR. Next, these mappers in conjunction with Clipping and Filtering (CF) technique are considered and it is shown that repeated clipping and frequency domain filtering in OFDM systems can significantly reduce the PAPR of the transmitted signal. The technique causes no increase in out-of-band power. Significant PAPR reduction can be achieved with only moderate levels of clipping. A comparison of the PAPR reduction capability of CPM mappers relative to memoryless BPSK mappers in an OFDM system is presented. It is noted that, in general, CPM mappers offer superior PAPR performance compared to memoryless mappers in an OFDM system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multi-Subcarrier OVSF Code Allocation in WCDMA</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Supporting multimedia applications with quality of service (QoS) requirements is one of the challenge goals in a wireless communication system. The third generation (3G) standards employ orthogonal variable spreading factor-wideband code division multiple access (OVSF-WCDMA) technologies which flexibly support mixed and variable data rate services. The orthogonal property of OVSF codes leads to code blocking which further gives call blocking. This paper proposed a new allocation model by adding multiple subcarriers in the same OVSF code tree structure. The aim of using multiple subcarriers is to reduce the internal and external fragmentation of an OVSF code tree. Several common single code assignment strategies, namely, random, left-most and crowded-first code are used. The simulation results show significant increase in the code tree utilization and reduction in the code blocking probability.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multi-Mode Multi-Level Continuous Phase Chirp Modulation: Coherent Detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, the concept of varying modulation parameters with respect to time is applied to multi-level Continuous Phase Chirp Modulation (M-CPCM). These multi-mode M-CPCM signals are described and illustrated as a function of time-varying sets of modulation parameters. Coherent detection of multi-mode M-CPCM in AWGN channel is addressed and its performance is evaluated in closed-form for symbol error rate. Optimum dual-mode M-CPCM systems are identified by minimizing symbol error rate. It is shown that advantage in terms of SNR can be obtained by using multi-mode instead of mono-mode M-CPCM signalling technique. A comparison of symbol error rate performance of multi-mode M-CPCM with conventional M-ary modulations is also provided.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy Efficient Adaptive Transmission in Generalized-K Fading Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) have become the key performance indicators for wireless communication systems. In this paper, the EE and SE, efficiency metrics, of digital communication systems and particular modulation technique are introduced. The upper bounds of the efficiency metrics over generalized-K fading channel are derived in closed form. For M-QAM modulation, these efficiency metrics are analyzed for several values of generalized-K channel parameters and M constellation size. The effect of roll-off bandwidth factor on the efficiency metrics is investigated as well. It is observed that the efficiency metrics are degraded by fading channel. Thus, enhancing technique for SE and EE is proposed which based on employing a modulation level of M-QAM to provide a maximum EE in a specific region of signal to noise ratio (SNR) while maintaining a certain QoS. The proposed technique improves the efficiency metrics for a wide operating range of SNR; however, more system complexity is expected.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Reconstruction-Error Distortion in LTI system modeling</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the order of a parametric Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system. To achieve this goal, we define a new objective function. This measure is denoted by reconstructionerror distortion. Tight probabilistic upper and lower bounds are obtained and a gap function for these bounds on the reconstruction-error distortion is derived. We propose to choose the order of the LTI system based on optimality the considered objective function in the form of reconstruction-error distortion. Information rate distortion function for this distortions is calculated. We show that the rate for reconstruction-error distortion is robust with respect to the probabilistic parameters in reconstruction error estimation. In addition, it is shown that the estimated order by reconstruction error distortion not only provides the maximum possible rate distortion, but also minimized the gap function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Perceptually Motivated Binaural Beamforming with Cues Preservation for Hearing Aids</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>In this contribution, a new binaural beamforming algorithm for hearing aids is introduced in order to generate binaural outputs with a good trade-off between noise reduction and binaural noise cues preservation. This includes cues preservation for the directional noise sources as well as diffuse-like background noise. The new algorithm is based on selection and mixing processes in the Time-Frequency domain (T-F) and is applicable for realistic T-F decompositions. The selection and mixing are done with a classification algorithm based on the complex coherence between the standard beamformer outputs and other available signals. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations have been performed using recorded signals provided by a hearing aid manufacturer. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can provide a good trade-off between noise reduction and binaural noise cues preservation, even for complex acoustic environments. </abstract>

        <papertitle>User-induced Antenna Variation and its Impact on the Performance of RSS-Based Indoor Positioning</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we investigate the impact of user proximity to handheld antenna on the performance of RSS-based indoor positioning. A planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) is designed for operation in 2.4 GHz and the changes in antenna characteristics due to proximity to human head are quantified using a commercial full-wave simulation software. Large variation in the radiation pattern of the PIFA, hence the measured RSS, is observed. These user-induced RSS variations are then mapped into positioning errors for several practical scenarios of resembling indoor wireless channels. </abstract>

        <papertitle>False Discovery Rate Controller for Functional Brain Parcellation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Parcellation of brain imaging data is desired for proper neurological interpretation in resting-state functional-magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. Some methods require specifying a number of parcels and using model selection to determine the number of parcels on a rs-fMRI dataset. However, this generalization does not fit with all subjects in a given dataset. A method has been proposed using parametric formulas for the distribution of modularity in random networks to determine the statistical significance between parcels. In this paper, we propose an agglomerative clustering algorithm using parametric formulas for the distribution of modularity in random networks, coupled with a false discovery rate (FDR) controller to parcellate rs-fMRI data. The proposed method combines FDR to reduce the number of false positives and incorporates spatial information to ensure the regions are spatially contiguous. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed FDR controlled method yields more accurate results when compared with existing methods. We also applied the proposed method to real a rs-fMRI dataset and found that it obtained higher reproducibility compared to the Ward hierarchical clustering method.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Machine Learning for Quality Prediction in Abrasion- Resistant Material Manufacturing Process</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Quality monitoring and prediction plays a key role in improving product quality and achieving automated quality control in manufacturing processes such as the abrasion-resistant material manufacturing process. Traditional methods that rely on the use of first-principle models are difficult to formulate due to the increasing complexity and high dimensionality of manufacturing processes. Data-driven machine learning methods offer an efficient way to learn models for quality prediction, in which the meaningful process information can be learned directly from large amounts of measured process data at different stages. In this paper, based on data collected throughout an abrasion-resistant material manufacturing process, product quality prediction of burned balls is achieved with the use of the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Peak Electricity Load Forecasting Using Online Support Vector Regression</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Load forecasting is essential in planning and operation of smart grid systems. Short term load forecasting (STLF) plays more important role from the generation perspectives. Existing methods of STLF are needed to remodel each time when new training data are included in the training set. This degrades overall efficiency of the system. In this paper we propose a method of STLF to update the trained model without remodeling by using online support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. In online SVR, changes of model parameters due to new training samples are updated in finite number of steps so that it meets the SVR optimization criteria. Real world data set of residential buildings in an area of Surrey, British Columbia are used to verify the system's performance and the proposed system showed promising results.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wavelet Based Real-Time Power Quality Monitoring</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Security of a power system is considered as the ability of the system to withstand disturbances without causing a breakdown. Any disturbance results in some power quality (PQ) issues. Poor power quality may have economic and operational impacts on both electric utilities and consumers. It is aimed that electric utilities must be able to supply high quality of power to consumers. Therefore, early detection of power quality problems is needed to allow a reasonable time for protection and controlling devices to interfere and take appropriate actions. In this work, power quality monitoring is proposed through wavelet energy distribution of a signal, mapped in time and frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform. The PQ issues such as voltage sag, voltage swell and momentary interruptions have been processed in a time window. The proposed detection algorithm provides meaningful detection of disturbance. Real time simulation is performed for power quality parameters analysis using real time simulator OPAL-RT. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Investigating the Switch Continuity Principle Assumed in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) researchers have always assumed the switch continuity principle (SCP), which assumes that only one appliance ever changes state at any given point in time. However, SCP cannot be relied upon 100% of the time, especially when unsupervised NILM is used to guess what appliances might be in a house. This principle breaks under certain conditions based on the data capture choices made: number of occupants, number of appliances, measurement unit, measurement precision, and sampling frequency. This paper identifies and explores the conditions under which SCP can and cannot be assumed. This is done through empirical tests performed on two of the most popular datasets used for NILM.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Power System Tracking State Estimation Based on Stochastic Fractal Search Technique under Sudden Load Changing Conditions</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Tracking state estimation gives a fast continuous update on the condition of the power system without modelling of the physical time fluctuating nature of the system. These estimation techniques are used to anticipate conceivable potential and security possibilities. Any enhancement in its estimation ability would enhance the security of the present electric networks. This paper discusses nonlinear power system application with Fractal search algorithm under sudden load changes. The application of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on IEEE 5, 14, 30, and 57 bus systems and the results are compared to Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to show the improvements. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Solving Very Large RWA Data Instances</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>While the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) has been widely studied, few studies attempt to solve realistic size instances, namely, with 100 wavelengths per fiber and a few hundred nodes. Indeed, state of the art is closer to around 20 nodes and 30 wavelengths, regardless of what the authors consider, heuristics or exact methods with very few exceptions. In this paper, we are interested in reducing the gap between realistic data sets and testbed instances that are often used, using exact methods. Even if exact methods may fail to solve in reasonable time very large instances, they however output bounds on the accuracy of the heuristic solutions. The novelty of our work is to exploit the observations that optimal solutions contain a very large number of lightpaths associated with shortest paths or k shortest paths with a small k. We propose different RWA algorithms that lead to solve exactly or near exactly much larger instances than in the literature with up to 150 wavelengths and 50 nodes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Dynamic Programming Offloading Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Computing</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Computational offloading is an effective method to address the resource constraints of mobile devices such as limited battery power, by executing some components of a mobile application in the cloud. In this paper, a novel approach to achieve energy savings while satisfying the execution time constraints of an application is presented. Our approach fills a 2 dimensional dynamic programming table in an innovative way, and uses randomization and a hamming distance criterion to find a nearly optimal offloading solution. The approach will offload as many tasks as possible to the cloud server when the network transmission bandwidth is high, thereby improving the total execution time of all tasks, and minimizing the energy consumption of the mobile device. The algorithm can find good solutions with low computational overhead. A novel approach to fill the dynamic programming table is used to avoid unnecessary computations when decided which tasks to offload, resulting in much lower energy costs and computation times. Furthermore, the algorithm is extensible to handle larger offloading problems without a loss of computational efficiency. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm saves energy while meeting an application's execution time requirements, and it is able to find a nearly optimal decision in a few iterations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Real-time parallel routing for telecom networks, Graph algorithms and bulk-synchronous parallel acceleration</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The fixed-time constrainted routing problem (FTCRP) is an engineering variant of the multicommodity network-flow problem where flows represent unsplittable telecommunication routes, and global solutions should be computed in at most one millisecond per route. Algorithmic solutions based on integer linear programming (ILP) lead to column generation (CG) heuristics to cope lazily with the exponential number of paths. In this paper we present experimental evidence that solving FTCRP with ILP leads to explosive time and memory consumption, while many innovative algorithms can alleviate this combinatorial explosion, and are also amenable to highly scalable bulk-synchronous (BSP) algorithms. We show several new solution methods tested on realistic instances with up to hundreds of thousands of routes and many dozens of computational cores with high efficiency.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An AQM based Congestion Control for eNB RLC in 4G/LTE Network</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In the context of a heterogeneous mobile environment, we analyze the eNodeB (eNB) Radio Link Control (RLC) buffer overflow problem for the 4G/LTE network, and show the benefits of deploying Active Queue Management (AQM) strategies at wireless access links. In order to satisfy the increasing demands of wireless mobile communications, LTE has been proposed as an all-IP-based network to bring higher peak data rates and better spectral efficiency. One of the LTE system performance optimization points is the RLC buffer management mainly at the downlink. RLC buffers at the eNB hold user data before it is selected by a MAC scheduler for transmission over the radio interface. A buffer management scheme is required to keep the RLC buffer occupancy to a minimal level without a noticeable degradation in user application performance. This is a challenging issue for the mobile network operator and has to be thoroughly investigated. When the traffic load is low, the available bandwidth is underutilized and when the traffic load is high, the end-to-end delay becomes large. This paper presents a minimal adjustment to RED called Smart RED (SmRED) in which the packet dropping probability is adjusted based on the traffic load to achieve optimal end-to end performance. Additionally, the migration from RED to SmRED in a real network needs very little work because of its simplicity. Finally, for a delaysensitive data stream, a cross layer approach based on SmRED is proposed to make it more practical.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Link Duration Estimation using Neural Networks based Mobility Prediction in Vehicular Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>The knowledge of Inter-vehicle link duration is an important parameter in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), as it is useful for vehicles to delay their information transmission if link breakage is anticipated before completing the transmission. In addition, it plays a pivotal role in routing, as it allows proactive constructing of long-life paths, and optimizing next-hop selection in position-based routing (PBR). However, due to the high mobility of vehicles and the complicated vehicular mobility patterns in urban areas, the estimation of link duration in urban VANETs is still an open research issue. Different from other complex link duration estimation methods, we introduce a lightweight neural networks (NNs) based mobility prediction scheme which allows vehicles to autonomously predict their future mobility speed for a certain time window. Then, the expected speed is used in an urban area mobility prediction model to estimate link duration between neighbouring vehicles. Extensive simulation results are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless Sensor Networks with Pressure-Based Energy Forecasting: A Simulation Study</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Small, inexpensive wireless sensor networks can be used to collect data i support of a number of tasks such as ecosystem or structural monitoring. When deployed in remote areas with little or no communication and power infrastructure, these networks face a number of power and reliability challenges. To collect adequate amount of data over long period of time, operation of such networks must be managed to properly ration energy available in suitable storage devices and in the environment. In particular, predictive energy management can extend the duration a node is operational during its deployment and thus increase the quality of the collected data. This contribution presents a simulation of a small wireless sensor network that employs a computationally inexpensive, short-term solar energy forecasts based on atmospheric pressure measurements as an input to a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control system. The proposed system shows improvement over a similar control scheme which only relies on knowledge of previously collected energy. Further improvements can be gained through optimization of the developed energy management scheme or by using more accurate energy availability prediction techniques.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Blind Forwarding for Secure and Private Communications in Untrusted Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>The longest prefix match is an algorithm used in&#13;
&#13;
routers to determine the next hop to which an entering packet &#13;
&#13;
must be forwarded based on its destination IP address. In this &#13;
&#13;
paper we present a blind forwarding scheme by implementing &#13;
&#13;
the longest prefix match algorithm using a homomorphic &#13;
&#13;
encryption scheme to deal with encrypted destination IP &#13;
&#13;
addresses. The goal of this protocol is to prevent any &#13;
&#13;
intermediate router from knowing which end server a given &#13;
&#13;
client is trying to reach, thus enabling the protection of the &#13;
&#13;
privacy of both the client and the server.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Retargeting and Enhancing a Compact Multitasking Kernel for the Altera Nios II Processor</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper describes the retargeting and further enhancement of a compact multitasking kernel for the 32-bit Altera Nios II processor. The kernel, called QUERK for Queen's University Educational Real-time Kernel, was originally written in assembly language and then the C language for the Motorola (and then Freescale) 68HC11 processor. Consisting of less than 200 lines of assembly-language instructions, the kernel was intended for educational purposes on undergraduate laboratory equipment in use at the time it was created. The software also supported undergraduate capstone project activity. To migrate the software to the 32-bit Altera Nios II processor that subsequently replaced the 8-bit 68HC11 in undergraduate laboratory activity, and to investigate issues arising from differences between the two instruction sets, this paper describes the retargeting of the kernel at the level of assembly language. The results reveal that the number of assembly-language source instructions increased by less than 9% for the Nios II in comparison to the 68HC11. Although many additional instructions are needed to save and restore the larger number of registers for the Nios II, reductions in the number of instructions needed in other parts of the kernel aid in offsetting that increase in instructions. Further enhancement of the kernel with support for timer delays is then described.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Dynamic Peer-assisted DASH Framework using Dynamic Updates and Prioritization Scheme</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we present an optimized framework for P2P video streaming using dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH). DASH is a very popular standard and is expected to dominate the adaptive streaming market. With the huge increase in video content streaming, the need for efficient streaming solutions is becoming more and more necessary. Our proposed framework defines several components; DASH session coordinator (DSC), intelligent content server (ICS), and adaptive streaming client (ASC). Each component has a defined set of rules as well as a simple messaging framework. In addition, all components work together in order to achieve optimized QoE for all clients streaming the same content during the same time interval. The proposed technique is customized for DASH. And provides higher priority for P2P streaming over direct streaming thus allowing client who download the same video contents to share the download instead of competing for higher bandwidth and consequently improve network utilization as well as client QoE. Results of our proposed technique showed an increase in client download rate by approximately 60% which is directly related the QoE perceived at client side. In addition, a reduction in number of playback stalls or pauses by 87% was achieved due to the elimination of bandwidth competition among clients. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Design and Implementation of BPSK MODEM for IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee Devices</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>ZigBee is one of the latest technologies used in Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). Designing an energy scalable ZigBee System on a Chip (SoC) is a demanding request for low power wireless sensor networks applications. In this paper, we focus on the main hardware module of the physical (PHY) layer of IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee devices, which is the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modem for 868 MHz band. We propose a new multiplier-less design for an FPGA-based BPSK modem using VHDL language. A digital signal-processing technique is used in order to generate and detect the BPSK symbols. Although, the BPSK demodulator is designed to match ZigBee PHY layer standard requirements, it can be used for other applications with very simple modifications. The proposed design is validated through the implementation on the AMIRIX AP1000 development platform.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Feature Reconstruction Based on Bilinear Models for Improved User-Independent Myoelectric Control and Reduced Training Samples</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>High classification accuracy and reasonable training samples are of central importance for designing a user-independent myoelectric control system in practice. Bilinear models, first introduced in the field of image processing, have the ability to factorize sets of surface electromygraphy (sEMG) data into user-related (Style) and gesture-related (Content) factors. It is anticipated that through appropriate feature reconstruction the recognition performance can be further improved and the training samples can be reduced. In this work, we aim to investigate the feasibility of realizing the two goals using bilinear models. We first factorize original training features into two factors, and then reconstruct dominant features with optimized model parameters. Afterwards, those features are employed to train a classifier. When original testing features from a novel user are available, they are used to adapt the two factors with the aid of the aforementioned model parameters (e.g. extracted Content), then reconstructed by the adapted factors and finally sent to the trained classifier for gesture recognition. Three 4-gesture tasks, termed as User-Dependent Cross-time (UDC), Original- User-Independent (OUI) and Bilinear-Models-User-Independent (BMUI) were conducted. Experimental results showed that the averaged classification accuracies of BMUI and OUI were 79.69%5.42% and 70.95%7.79% respectively. The one-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated that the proposed method significantly improved the classification accuracy (p=0.03). Besides, the averaged accuracies of BMUI and UDC were also compared, where BMUI employed data from multiple users in a single day for training and UDC employed data from the same user across multiple days. Although the accuracy of BMUI was lower than that of UDC, they were statistically insignificant (p=0.18). Therefore, the training samples could be significantly reduced since each subject will conduct only once experiment for training. This study provides an effective solution not only for improving recognition performance, but also for reducing training samples.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Comparison of a new ad-hoc classification method with Support Vector Machine and Ensemble classifiers for the diagnosis of Meniere's disease using EVestG signals</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we compared the performance of our previously designed ad-hoc classifier with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a family of ensemble learners on classification of patients with Meniere's disease (MD) based on Electrovestibulography (EVestG) signals. The ad-hoc classifier was developed based on the average vote of classifiers each built for a single feature using Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA). The training and test datasets included EVestG signals recorded from 14 MD patients and 16 age-matched healthy controls for training and 9 MD patients and 10 age-matched controls for test dataset. The feature space was built based on the EVestG characteristic signals produced in response to side tilt stimulation. The most discriminative features of the training set were selected using the minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevancy (mRMR) algorithm following one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). SVM and three ensemble methods, including Bagging, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and Random Subspace methods were used for comparing the classification performance with that of our ad-hoc voting classifier. The classification results on the test data set showed that the ad-hoc voting classifier outperformed the competitor algorithms in terms of sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. The implications of the results are discussed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Feasibility of Support Vector Machine Gesture Classification on a Wearable Embedded Device</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This study looks at the need for a device that monitors upper extremity movements. The device needs to be able to predict gestures on-board to provide immediate feedback. Linear Discriminate Analysis and Support Vector Machine light and Support Vector Machine multiclass libraries were implemented on an Atmel embedded system to investigate the limitations. For the Support Vector Machine light implementation the peak memory usage was 2 Mb and used a sample size of 20 samples per class. The implementation of Support Vector Machine multiclass with 5 classes, had peak memory usage of 1Mb and 20 samples per class. The work presented here establishes the ground work for creating a stand-alone device with on-board classification.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Bayesian Optimization of BCI parameters</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>In motor-imagery based synchronous Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), the EEG frequency bands and the time intervals from which the features are extracted should be selected based on the brain characteristics of each user. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic algorithm that uses Bayesian optimization to tune hyper-parameters of a BCI system. In each iteration of our algorithm a set of values for the hyper-parameters is proposed. Each set is then used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier and the results of all these classifiers are aggregated using multi-response linear regression. We show that finding proper values for these hyper-parameters considerably improves the accuracy of BCIs. Furthermore, our results yield better performance compared to the best reported results in the literature. The average accuracy of our method over the BCI competition III dataset 3b is 2.6% better than existing methods. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Mutual information based detection of thermal profile in hand joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients using non-parametric windows</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Rheumatoid arthritis is a kind of auto-immune joint disease causing inflammation, swelling and stiffness in joints. Due to this inflammation the heat distribution over the joint changes and becomes an asymmetric pattern. One of the useful methods for localizing abnormal regions in the body is analyzing heat distribution over the skin. Normally, temperature has a symmetric distribution and asymmetric patterns can be a sign of special disease. Mutual information is a method that can be used to measure ambiguity or similarity between random variables. Non-parametric window is also useful for estimating joint histogram and thus mutual information between images. In this study mutual information is used as a tool to measure similarity between pairs of images. Results show that there is a meaningful difference between patient and control group (p-value &lt; 0.05 at 5% significance level) using proposed method.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Sizing of Wind/Solar Mix for Supply Security of Active Power Distribution Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Renewable resources planning is a key tool in active power distribution systems. In this paper, an optimal sizing of wind/solar mix considering supply security is presented. The proposed methodology utilizes the negative correlation between solar and wind output power to ensure a certain level of supply security and load fulfillment. The effect of formulating the design optimization problem on the optimal wind/solar mix and power system operation is studied. The IEEE 38-bus system with selected candidate locations for renewable resources is used to demonstrate the proposed design methodology. The forward backward sweep power flow technique is used to evaluate the obtained design results. Using the squared difference between generated power and targeted load fulfillment as the objective function for minimization resulted in the best performance and achieved the required load fulfillment ratio without degrading the power system operation constraints.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy Management Strategy of On-grid/Off-grid Wind Energy Battery-Storage System</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In on-grid/off-grid wind energy conversion systems (WECS), a backup capacity is usually required in order to deal with high and low energy generation situations and to make the system more autonomous. In this paper, a nonlinear energy management control scheme for a WECS which includes a battery-storage unit with the capability to flexibly operate in grid-connected and standalone modes is proposed. The main purpose is to minimize the grid contribution efficiently and to ensure load-supply continuity in both modes. The proposed system utilizes an unified controller contrary to the conventional methods which use a different controller for each mode of operation. In addition, the dc-link voltage and the active power are controlled directly by the battery-side bi-directional buck-boost DC/DC converter using a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear control method based feedback linearization theory. The grid-side voltage source converter controls the load voltage using a PI controller. The performance of the proposed control system is evaluated in simulation. The results demonstrate that it gives high dynamic responses in response to grid power outage and load variation as well as zero steady-state error.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Efficient Simulation of Wind Farms Using Switching Reduced Models of Converters and VBR Formulation of Six˗Phase PM Synchronous Generators</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Wind generation systems commonly utilize several power electronics converters with variable frequency generators. Using numerically efficient models for converters and electrical machines can decrease simulation time of wind farms. In this paper, a voltage-behind-reactance model is developed for a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous generator. Then a multi-resolution methodology is presented which utilizes different combinations of detailed and average-value models of twelve-pulse rectifier and three-phase inverter systems in conjunction with different six-phase machine models. The presented models are verified through simulation results to provide superior performance in terms of speed and numerical efficiency.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimization of Wind Turbine and Sensitive Equipment Placement</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Lightning is a potential risk factor for wind turbines as the transient voltage may reach dangerous levels. Therefore, similar to other buildings and sensitive electrical installations, it is important to consider lightning and its consequences when deciding the location of wind turbines. The objective of this study is to optimize the location of wind farms to minimize lightning strikes on wind turbines. The method can also be applied to optimize the placement of any other sensitive installation for minimum electromagnetic interference from lightning current in any geographic area. The process involves gathering accurate lightning information for a desired area from North American Lightning Detection Network (NALDN) over a period of time and using the genetic algorithm optimization technique to determine the wind farm location and the placement of other sensitive equipment. We found that the genetic algorithm optimization technique produces consistent results for different scenarios. The findings of this study help designers to consider lightning, in addition to other factors, for energy collecting efficiency of wind turbines when determining the best location of wind farms.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Enhancing the Performance of Controlled Distributed Energy Resources in Noisy Communication Environments</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Recent works proposed controlling distributed distributed energy resources (DERs) for the purpose of power system re-stabilization during transient instability periods. Further, it was reported that such control schemes struggle when the communication links between the sensors and the distributed controllers are noisy. This work investigates applying robust control techniques to enhance the performance of controlled DERs in noisy communication environments. The performance of the proposed control scheme is investigated on the 39-bus 10-generator New England test power system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Transmission line length, operating condition and rating regime</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>With an increased focus on renewable power generation, dynamic line rating is being investigated as a way to connect the new intermittent generation to the grid without needing to build additional infrastructure. The number of transmission lines available for dynamic line rating depends on the length of each transmission line. The St. Clair curve is typically used be industry to determine the length of transmission lines that are thermally rated. This paper will extend this curve by including reactive power in the calculations. This paper will also demonstrate the effect that changing the capacity of the line due to dynamic line rating has on the length of transmission line that is thermally rated.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Predictive Line Rating In Underground Transmission Lines Going Beyond Dynamic Line Rating</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper investigates a predictive method for optimization of underground transmission line rating based on weather forecast information. Transmission lines are essential and indispensable parts of the electric grid which basically take energy from the production point to where it is needed. Line rating defined as line's maximum capacity to transfer electric current and power safely and reliably under certain constraints and criteria. To ensure safe operation, rating has been classically calculated according to worst case scenario, where conductor's temperature rise would remain within specified limit under most unfavorable conditions. Obviously, such an approach leads to very conservative results, leaving line mostly underutilized throughout its life span. In order to optimize line utilization, ambient adjusted rating and more recently dynamic line rating methods are developed. For instance, in dynamic line rating, real-time data are used to determine instantaneous line rating. We have investigated development of a predictive model for underground transmission lines by employing weather forecast information, which enables line operators or owners to anticipate optimized line ampacity and rating over the next few days. The model builds upon the already-developed and well-documented analogy between thermal and electrical circuits. Deterministic weather forecast information can be collected from Environment Canada.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Impact of Parameter Variation of Arc Flash on Hazard Mitigation in Low Voltage Power Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Every year, electricians are victims of electric hazards. The primary concerns related to the electric hazards are electric shocks and arc flash. Therefore, electric safety in the workplace is an important topic that is addressed by different regulation bodies in USA, Canada and the European Union. In recent years, the focus on the area of arc flash hazard analysis has become a mandatory safety tool that helps to identify the incident energy level the workers may be exposed to, and informs about the protective equipment that must be worn. This paper addresses the effect of the uncertainty of arc flash parameters such as voltage, gap between electrodes, and arcing time on the incident energy. Such variations in arc flash parameters are applied to different hazard mitigation techniques. Finally, a procedure to include the parameter variation in arc flash calculations is proposed. Results of a practical case study show the improvement in hazard mitigation achieved by accounting for parameter uncertainty.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Spatial direction corrections to improve indoor localization using inertial navigation with sensors on a smartphone</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>We present results of an improved smartphone based inertial navigation based indoor localization system. Spatial constraints drawn from domain specific knowledge for direction correction and actual velocity model for velocity correction are applied to increase the accuracy by counteracting the accumulation of large drift caused by sensor reading errors. We investigated the accuracy of the algorithm with diverse experiments of walks along corridors. Our results show that the proposed method achieves a reduction in percentage error by 0.9\% with a 30\% less variance over Step and Heading approach proving the accuracy and robustness of proposed method. We also investigated the frequency of applying corrections and found that a 4-5\% corrections per step is required for improved accuracy. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Novel velocity model to improve indoor localization using inertial navigation with sensors on a smartphone</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>We present a generalized velocity model to improve localization when using an Inertial Navigation System (INS). This algorithm was applied to correct the velocity of a smartphone based indoor INS system to increase the accuracy by counteracting the accumulation of large drift caused by sensor reading errors. We investigated the accuracy of the algorithm with three different velocity models which were derived from the actual velocity measured at the hip of walking person. Our results show that the proposed method with Gaussian velocity model achieves competitive accuracy with a 50\% less variance over Step and Heading approach proving the accuracy and robustness of proposed method. We also investigated the frequency of applying corrections and found that a minimum of 5\% corrections per step is sufficient for improved accuracy. The proposed method is applicable in indoor localization and tracking applications based on smartphone where traditional approaches such as GNSS suffers from many issues.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Penalty Convex-Concave Procedure for Source Localization Problem</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we focus on the least-squares (LS) formulation for the localization problem, where the l2-norm of the residual errors is minimized in a setting known as difference-of-convex-functions programming. The problem at hand is then solved by applying a penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) in a successive manner. Algorithmic details that are tailored to the localization problem, such as imposing additional constraints to enforce iteration path towards the LS solution and strategies to secure a good initial point, are also provided. Simulation results demonstrate promising localization performance when compared with some best known results from the literature. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Intelligent Intrusion Prevention System For Households Based on System-On-Chip Computer</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Over the course of the last few decades, security systems have undergone radical overhauls and have transitioned into such sophisticated devices that some even completely shun any form of human interventions. In spite of its tremendous innovations, however, such setups have not yet made their way into homes and residences, partly owing to the fact that the equipment bear high price tags and lack user friendliness. This paper propositions a unique security system for residences that aims to solve the shortcomings of commercial alternatives. Basically, a Raspberry Pi 2 System-on-Chip (SoC) computer equipped with a camera module and placed outside the entrance of a house would attempt to identify would-be visitors by the means of image processing and voice identification. The system would spontaneously greet known faces with a friendly voice greeting and unlock the main door to allow them to enter the home. In case of unknown faces, the system would initiate a video call to the home's owner through a smartphone application and allow the owner to communicate with the unknown visitor. Upon receiving approval from the owner, the visitor's details would be entered into the system and the main door would be unlocked. If the owner denies access, he or she has the option to verbally ask the unknown visitor to leave or in extreme cases, press a button to call the police.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Heterogeneous Memory Organization with Minimum Energy Consumption in 3D Chip- Multiprocessors</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Main memories play an important role in overall energy consumption of embedded systems. Using conventional memory technologies in future designs in nanoscale era cause a drastic increase in leakage power consumption and temperature related problems. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies offer many desirable characteristics such as near-zero leakage power, high density and non-volatility. They can significantly mitigate the issue of memory leakage power in future embedded chip-multiprocessor (eCMP) systems. However, they suffer from challenges such as limited write endurance and high write energy consumption which restrict them for adoption in modern memory systems. In this article, we propose a stacked hybrid memory system for 3D chip-multiprocessors to take advantages of both traditional and non-volatile memory technologies. For reaching this target, we present a convex optimization-based model that minimizes the system energy consumption while satisfy endurance constraint in order to design a reliable memory system. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves energy-delay product (EDP) and performance by about 44.8% and 13.8% on average respectively compared with the traditional memory design where single technology is used.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Development of a Credible and Integrated Electronic Voting Machine Based on Contactless IC Cards, Biometric Fingerprint Credentials and POS Printer</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>In recent times there has been a decline in the confidence of common people over electronic voting machines (EVMs). More anticipated than what the reality actually is, today's automated vote casting methods have faced immense controversy related to being vulnerable to hacking and questions have been raised about their transparency and security. This paper proposes the design and development of a novel fault tolerant electronic voting system that aims to mitigate the recurring issues and flaws of existing voting machines of today. To elucidate the system in brief, a two stage verification process would be carried out on a potential voter by the means of fingerprint recognition and a Near Field Communication (NFC) smart card entry in order to authenticate his or her identity. Subsequently, the person would cast the vote by pressing a button corresponding to a particular candidate which would be recorded in the system providing the vote caster a visual confirmation. The final vote would then be printed out spontaneously onto a ballot box using a POS printer for an added level of validation. This system not only prevents multiple vote casts, but also eliminates the discrepancies that commonly arise with a person claiming not to have voted, whereas his or her name is present in the list of vote casters. The project is an incremental extension of a previous research.</abstract>

        <papertitle>TEFS: A Flash File System for Use on Memory Constrained Devices</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>A file system is used to manage data on storage media. The FAT (File Allocation Table) file system was originally designed for floppy drives that were less than 500KB in size, and these drives were not capable of fast random reads and writes. FAT has been adapted to work on other types of storage devices since, and it is still widely used today. It is the standard file system used by microprocessors and embedded devices with constrained resources. Micro-controllers, like the Arduino, only officially support the FAT file system when interacting with a SD card. FAT performs well when data is read or written sequentially, but when data is read or written randomly, there is an impact on performance for large files on page based flash devices that cannot utilize caching strategies. Applications that perform random reading and writing are impacted by this architectural issue. For example, flash data structures, like a B-tree, will have poor performance since random reading is utilized to look up values. TEFS (Tiny Embedded File System) uses a tree indexing structure to take advantage of the fast random reads and writes of flash storage and guarantees that the number of page reads and writes will stay constant as the file size increases when randomly reading or writing. Experimental results show that TEFS has significantly better performance than FAT for random I/Os, and the more efficient TEFS implementation is even slightly faster than FAT for sequential reading and writing.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rapid design space exploration of multi-clock domain MPSoCs with Hybrid Prototyping</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents novel techniques of using hybrid prototyping for early power-performance analysis of MPSoC designs with multiple clock domains. The fundamental idea of hybrid prototyping is to simulate a design with multiple cores by creating an emulation kernel in software on top of a single physical instance of the core. However, so far hybrid prototyping has been limited to homogeneous multicores running at the same clock frequency. Moreover, hybrid prototyping has not yet been demonstrated for efficient design space exploration. Our work focuses on enhancing the capabilities of hybrid prototyping, such that it can be applied to realistic multi-clock MPSoC designs as well to perform early power-performance evaluation of MPSoC designs. Our experiments using industrial strength applications such as JPEG, MP3 and Packet Processing, demonstrate the high accuracy of our hybrid prototypes, and over two orders of magnitude improvement over software simulation speed. We also demonstrate that exploring over 150 design options using hybrid prototyping can be done with high reliability in the order of minutes compared to multiple days using conventional FPGA prototyping.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Integration of Price-Driven Demand Response Using Plug-in Electric Vehicles in Smart Grids</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper discusses price-driven demand response based on plug-in electric vehicles. In order to evaluate the potential grid impact of electric cars' integration to smart grids, a charging strategy based on transactive control is proposed. This strategy enables electric vehicle owners to participate in a real-time pricing retail electricity market in order to reduce their charging costs. The result, in terms of price elasticity of demand, indicates the degree of responsiveness for electric vehicles. Large-scale adoption of electric vehicles is expected to change electricity generation schedules and inter-regional trades. In order to quantify potential changes, an interconnection-scale optimal scheduling problem is solved to determine hourly tieline flows between system control areas. In the presence of demand response, the objective function of the scheduler is to maximize the total social welfare (i.e., economic surplus) rather than minimize production cost. Furthermore, every control area is assumed to deal with its intra-hourly demand and generation fluctuations and at the same time maintain scheduled imports and exports. We show that demand response resources can contribute to maintaining the balance between demand and generation, which enables control areas to utilize economic slow-ramping generation units for system control in presence of intermittent renewable resources.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Implications of Transportation Electrification in Metro Vancouver</papertitle>
        <trackname>Invited Sessions</trackname>
        <abstract>The fleet composition forecasted to the year 2020 for the new portion of light and medium duty vehicles (LMDV) in Metro Vancouver is analyzed. Sixteen scenarios of zero tailpipe emission Electric Vehicle (EV) penetration in the new fleet were investigated. These scenarios focus on electricity and hydrogen. The study assesses the efficiency of EV technologies, quantifies the electric transportation energy demand, and summarises the implications of using electricity to power the transportation sector. The analysis shows that from the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) options, battery electric vehicles (BEV) have better energy efficiency. The electricity demand ranges from 32 to 248 GWh yr- 1 across the scenarios. The larger numbers are due to the hydrogen production via electrolysis. If the required energy were produced via renewable energy sources, e.g., solar or wind, the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions could decrease up to 96%.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Towards Virtualisation and Secured Software Defined Networking for Wireless and Cellular Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper centres on the study of concepts and applications of software defined networking (SDN) which is a network architecture that decouples the network control logic from the underlying network infrastructure elements. Separation of the control plane from the data plane is the basic principle of SDN. This gives a separation of functions which leads to better scalability, programmability, interoperation, performance and ease of management. SDN helps to keep up with the increasing demand for connectivity and bandwidth. This paper presents a review on how SDN can help drive development of network function virtualisation. Application of SDN to cellular and wireless networks is also studied. Finally, vulnerabilities associated with SDN are discussed and recommendations are offered on how to make SDN more secure and reliable. A detailed architecture for a mobile cellular system is proposed as well as recommendations to improve security of these systems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Physical and Logical Topology Slicing Through SDN</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper demonstrate the physical and logical topological slicing in computer networks through Software De- fined Networks (SDN) with the added benefit of data privacy. To deal with the complex requirements of the modern net- works, sudden re-configuration of a network is often required. Modern applications require the configuration of networks on a fly according to dynamically changing requirements, but the conventional solutions need to configure each and every device locally. The real time requirements are dynamic and the network configuration is static in nature. SDN provides a better option by enabling programmable interfaces on network hardware and with a centralized control to implement. Based on a simulated topology, this paper presents the physical and logical topology slicing under a centralised control and by using SDN with no need of the local configuration of the network elements.</abstract>

        <papertitle>SDN Based Emulation of an Academic Networking Testbed</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents an emulated model of an academic networking testbed by using SDN. This emulated model consists of switching and routing topologies and has been tested to be successfully working for spanning tree and layer three functionality. The increasing prices of the the every new generation of networking hardware puts budgetary challenges to academic units. The need of additional hardware resources to accommodate more users adds to the complexity of pre-existing situation. This work intends to present an alternative to the physical resources through a virtual setup with SDN. The overall objective is to reduce the cost of ownership to achieve the same functionality. This work also identifies the challenges and obstacles in the adoption of SDN for such an emulation. The evaluation of the SDN emulation has been proved to work appropriately through rigorous testing.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimizing Handover Parameters for Self-Organizing Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>In order to maintain high quality communication systems, user equipments should always be connected to the best serving cells and this is achieved through the process of handover. In Self-Organizing Networks (SONs), handover parameters have to be tuned and optimized autonomously to reduce failures and maintenance expenditures. In this work, those parameters: Handover Margin (HOM) and Time-To-Trigger (TTT) are optimized using Fuzzy, Genetic, and Fuzzy-Genetic algorithms. The system is modeled and simulated using MATLAB, and comparisons regarding Call Drop Ratio (CDR), Handover Margin (HOR) and the computational complexity represented by the consumed time are shown to evaluate the performance of each approach. Results show that the proposed approaches are eligible to optimize the handover process.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Cloud-Enabled Vehicular Congestion Estimation: An ITS Application</papertitle>
        <trackname>Communications and Networks</trackname>
        <abstract>Traffic increase and hence congestion is a major problem in cities or urban areas. To mitigate this problem of congestion the real-time traffic data and density estimation model is essential. This research proposes one such model for estimating the traffic congestion level with the help of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) and Cloud Computing. In this work, a novel architecture and algorithm has been proposed to find the density of the vehicles on the road in addition to average speed. The fuzzy logic based algorithm also estimates congestion on the roads both in real-time and on the historical traffic data. The deployment of this model provides Software as a Service (SaaS) as per the user requirement for a particular duration of a day.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Partially blurred Images Restoration Using Adaptive Multi-Stage Approach</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents an efficient image restoration algorithm that is content adaptive. Traditional image restoration or de-blurring algorithms apply the same logic on the whole image even when only few image blocks are blurry. The developed algorithm is designed to provide less calculation complexity and save the un-blurred image parts quality during the de-blurring process. This algorithm is mainly designed to get the best extracted quality from more than one blurred images. Our proposed approach consists of three main stages. In the first stage, the detection of blurry blocks of an image is performed. In the second stage, a partial de-blurring is applied to the detected blurry blocks. In the third and final stage, an image fusion technique is used to fuse the de-blurred blocks back into the image to be restored. MATLAB was used for our simulation results. Simulation results using various evaluation metrics showed that our proposed approach has achieved up to 14 dB (36%) enhancement based on PSNR for partially blurred images where blurry blocks are not in the same spatial position in the input images and close to 1 dB in cases where the blurry blocks are in the same spatial position</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Framework for Personalized Display Systems Using Non-Intrusive Features and Interest Detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Personalized advertising has gained considerable momentum in the digital marketplace, but most commercial systems still suffer from inefficient space utilization and clutter for the user. This paper introduces a system for Personalized Display Systems (PDS) by non-intrusively collecting 3 key demographic features: age, gender and ethnicity. Specifically, the proposed system has 3 modes of operation: an observation phase to build a repository of content preference examples, a learning phase that finds subjective preference from the repository, and a prediction phase that uses the learning model to predict content. The proposed system is non-intrusive because age, gender and ethnicity are detected without establishing the subject's identity. Furthermore, competing content is ranked by measuring demographic-specific Visual Attention Duration (VAD).&#13;

        <papertitle>An Analysis of University Course Timetabling Problem Heuristics and Algorithms</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>The university course timetabling problem is an optimization problem which poses great difficulty. The subjective nature of its potential constraints and the varying sizes that the optimization must take place on makes the problem very difficult to solve in a limited amount of time, in fact, this time could become non-deterministic (NP-hard). This paper analyzes multiple methods used to deal with the university course timetabling problem. Local search methods, genetic algorithms and other heuristics are tested in order to determine the most capable method in terms of finding the most feasible timetables. Hybridized genetic algorithms with other local search methods seem to provide the best results, consequently, a method of genetic algorithms and local search hybridization is proposed as an implementation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Implementation of Decoders for Symmetric Low Density Parity Check Codes on Parallel Computation Platforms using OpenCL</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>OpenCL is a high-level language that allows mixed hardware/software systems to be specified and compiled to run on heterogeneous parallel computing platforms. The hardware parallelism can take the form of multi-core central processing units (CPUs), massively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs), and, most recently, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) fabrics. OpenCL compilers for CPUs and GPUs have been available for over 6 years, but only recently has compiler support been extended to include FPGAs. This paper investigates OpenCL designs for the computationally demanding iterative decoding algorithm for low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The LDPC decoding algorithm offers several kinds of potentially exploitable parallelism. Our objective was to investigate the design trade-offs in OpenCL that will produce the best performance when compiled by the Altera Offline Compiler (AOC v15.1) for OpenCL-to-FPGA.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Fast Simulation-Based Verification of RC Power Grids</papertitle>
        <trackname>Computer and Software Engineering</trackname>
        <abstract>To guarantee its safety, the power delivery network (PDN) must undergo a sequence of verification steps throughout the integrated circuit (IC) design flow. This involves checking that the voltage fluctuations in the grid remain within some user-specified safety threshold. Typically, this is done by performing a transient simulation of the grid under certain input current traces. Existing simulation tools require solving a large number of linear systems, making the tools slow for modern power grids containing billions of nodes. We propose a new simulation based approach for RC power grid verification that generates envelope upper bound waveforms on the true voltage drop waveforms. The envelope waveforms capture the peaks of the voltage drops quiet accurately while requiring a much smaller number of system solves than modern tools.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Toward Study of Features Associated with Natural Sleep Posture using a Depth Sensor</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Estimating the sleeping posture of a person under natural resting environment is a very complex problem. In this study, a new non-invasive framework is proposed for exploring features defining sleep postures of a person. Three dimensional depth scans as well as the cross-sectional scans of the static sleeping body are developed using the measured depth data. These features can then be used in order to estimate the changes in patterns associated with the head, limbs and torso position in depth images. Scans of the sleeping postures are taken at various cross sectional directions. 1D and 2D Fast Fourier Transformation are explored in order to provide complementary feature of the scans. We also generate grids on the horizontal sleeping plane. In the depth image, each grid has a quadrangle configuration which can further be divided into two triangular meshes. We calculated a surface normal vector to each of the mesh. Given a 2D scan strip perpendicular for the sleeping plane, variations of the normal along such scan strips can be used as other local features. These selected features can be further integrated as a part of natural sleep posture estimation methods.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Analytical solution and Parameter Assessment for heat source located under skin: An approach to chest tumor detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Body temperature could be utilized for diagnosis of the many health related conditions. Since, tumors are highly vascular, temperature variations on the skin surface could be treated as a symptom for tumor detection. Therefore, infrared (IR) cameras could be used as a non ionizing, non contact, and a safe method of tumor detection. Studying thermograms obtained from such cameras, tumor parameters such as depth and radius could be assessed. Additionally, employing artificial neural networks (ANN), such parameters are optimized for a more accurate diagnosis and a better cancer treatment. The present study has revised and analyzed the aforementioned parameters and presents a newly derived equation based on Penne's bio-heat equation in order to validate obtained results. Furthermore, it was found that surface temperature is the most sensitive parameter in tumor localization, hence, using a well calibrated camera is essential for surface heat detection and cancer identification.&#13;

        <papertitle>A Low Power Dirac Basis Compressed Sensing Framework for EEG using a Meyer Wavelet Function Dictionary</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>The transmission of Electroencephalography (EEG) in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) consumes high power, relatively to the battery size which is available on the sensor board. The power consumption is dominated by the sensing, processing and the data transmission module. Lots of successful solutions are proposed which are based on Compressed Sensing (CS) and other techniques too. Lots of previous frameworks have shown to achieve low power consumption by minimizing the communication power, by achieving a high compression rate. However, these frameworks have high recovery errors and it only reduces the communication power. In this paper, we propose to reduce the sensing and processing power by random sampling the EEG signal achieving high compression rate and low recovery error. We build a basis dictionary, which has a multiple band-pass Meyer wavelet. We observed that it is incoherent with the random Dirac basis sensing. The dictionary promotes optimal sparse basis and optimal incoherence. The proposed technique achieved low decompression errors at high compression rates such as 10:1 achieving ultra-low power consumption since the sensing matrix multiplication operation is replaced by a random Sampling circuit (simulated by a Dirac sensing matrix). We showed an analysis that indicates significant power consumption reduction.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Tracking hand movements and detecting grasp</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Post stroke rehabilitation exercise are often repetitive and monotonous. Interactive gaming technology plays an important role of encouraging patients to exercise more. In this paper, a real-time method for interaction between human and computer is explored which utilizes Microsoft Kinect to measure hand movements and detect grasp gesture. This approach could be integrated into a computer game which, for instance, simulates the pick and place exercise during rehabilitation of individuals with stroke. The hand's binary image and its corresponding depth data were collected using Kinect. Then a SVM classifier was trained to detect grasp gesture. Trained model was tested online for classifying grasp and non-grasp hand gestures. The trained model was able to detect grasp gesture with 89.1% accuracy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Adaptive illumination backlight panel for ELISA imaging systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper demonstrates the adaptive illumination methods for the implementations of Colorimetric (also known as absorbance detection), Fluorescence and Luminescence ELISA models using a standalone or mobile imaging setup with data processing techniques and prediction algorithms. These ELISA modelling systems, as discussed in this paper mainly depends on the quality of the images and the image processing algorithms employed for accuracy and reliability. The assay concentration estimations for such systems are greatly dependent upon the light absorbance and transmittance properties of the chemical compounds that make up the analytic biochemistry assay and are highly influenced by the quality and intensity of the backlight panel used in these device setups.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Variable Battery Supply DC-DC Buck Converter Designed for 45nm-CMOS Technology</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, a buck DC-DC converter is presented that is capable of operation under variable input battery voltage ranging from 3.5V to 6V. The proposed converter is based on a new design technique using an adaptive biasing circuit for cascode power stage. The biasing circuit changes its configuration when the battery voltage drops down to 4.5V. The converter is implemented in 45-nm CMOS technology; it was simulated and its operation was verified at an output power of 200mW where it achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency of 81% for an output voltage of 1.25V.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Comparison of Passive Rectifier Circuits for Energy Harvesting Applications</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Recent developments in the design of low-power circuits have allowed Energy Harvesting (EH) systems to feed electronic circuits that execute complex processes, permitting that such systems play an important role in different application areas (e.g. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), biomedical devices, Internet of things (IoT), among others). Due to the low power output presented by these systems (in the range of uW to mW), the reduction of any potential losses presented in the circuits that form the EH system is a mayor issue; therefore, a careful selection of the circuits and its components may improve the performance. In this work, a comparison of various rectifier circuits founded in the EH literature is presented. Based on the operation of each rectifier, the modeling of the power losses of each circuit will be introduced. Finally, the simulation results of the considered circuits are presented with the aim to measure parameters, like the efficiency, and perform a quantitative comparison.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Set-Point Tracking of a DC-DC Boost Converter through Optimized PID Controllers</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Controlling boost converter having a right-half-plane zero in its transfer function as compared to buck converter is a difficult task to accomplish. This paper suggests the optimization of the traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithms for the boost converter through the unconstrained nonlinear optimization technique. This reduces the labor for finding out the well-tuned PID controller parameters for nonminimum phase plants like boost converter. Firstly, the Ziegler-Nichols improved open-loop step response method and its variants and the closed-loop step response method are employed to get the nominal values of PID parameters. Secondly, the parameters are further tuned using the unconstrained nonlinear optimization technique to boost the performance of the compensated system. MATLAB/Simulink results are provided to compare the performance of the conventional and the optimized PID controllers.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal MPC-Based Energy Management of Multiport Power Electronics Interface for Hybrid Energy Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The Multiport Power Electronics Interface (MPEI) has the advantages of low cost, high efficiency, high power density, high reliability, and ease of management over conventional multiple-converter based distributed power systems. Therefore, it is considered as the best candidate for integrating hybrid energy sources, especially when renewable sources are locally available, to supply low- to medium-power range applications such as microgrids, rural areas, military camps and critical industrial zones. In this paper, a comprehensive energy management system (EMS) of MPEI for hybrid energy sources based on predictive control is proposed. The proposed system consists of a grid-connected MPEI that integrates three types of energy sources—dispatchable, nondispatchable, and energy storage—to feed a local load. The objectives of the proposed EMS are to minimize the total daily operating cost of the system with the optimal use of the energy resources, minimize diesel fuel consumption, and minimize pollutant gas emissions while considering the physical and practical constraints of different energy sources. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear dynamic optimization framework that can be solved using the SCIP solver, which is non-commercial solver that solves these kinds of problems. The MATLAB® software program is utilized along with the YALMIP optimization tool in the implementation of the proposed EMS to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Modeling and Nonlinear Control of Multilevel Inverter for Photovoltaic Application</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>The present work deals with a nonlinear control strategy for the purpose of photovoltaic (PV) systems integration into the power system through cascaded Z-source H-bridge inverters. The topology of the proposed system which is able to obtain a 5-level voltage is discussed. To facilitate a systematic voltage control, an exact nonlinear model of the proposed system is presented. A nonlinear voltage regulator, based on exact input-output feedback linearization scheme, is designed to maintain the terminal voltage of the PV inverter at the point of common coupling. Moreover, to harvest the maximum power from the PV arrays, a nonlinear controller for a dc-dc converter which is in conjunction with the maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is designed. The performance of the proposed Z-source multilevel inverter is evaluated numerically in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results validate the performance of the proposed model-based controller in both steady-state and transient conditions, since the nonlinearity of the system is taken into consideration.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Analyzing Multiresolution Wavelet Entropy of ECG with Visual Analytics Techniques</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Wavelet entropy is an analysis tool applicable to biomedical signals, including EEG and ECG. The current paper proposes an application of methods from visual analytics to time-frequency energy distribution in ECG signals, with the goal of studying heart rate variability from the main ECG band corresponding to heart rate. Such an approach can complement standard time- and frequency-domain techniques for heart rate variability assessment. Multiresolution wavelet entropy was computed from continuous wavelet transforms using windows of user-specified length and overlap. An interactive tool provides visualization of multiresolution entropy heat maps. This approach was used to compare ECG wavelet entropy in subjects during resting and stressor conditions. The interactive visual representation allows a detailed examination of wavelet entropy, revealing time-varying differences in the complexity of the underlying ECGs that are not evident in traditional measures. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Real-time Heartbeat Outlier Removal in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Biometric System</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Electrocardiogram signal is prone to noise interference. Processing noisy signals in an automated system such as biometric systems negatively affects its performance. In this paper, we developed a real-time abnormal electrocardiogram heartbeat detection and removal. The proposed technique eliminates outliers in real-time while subjects data are being collected regardless whether the examined subjects have been seen or unseen before. We used Gaussian mixture model to model normal electrocardiogram heartbeat. A Gaussian mixture of 2 components achieved the least equal error rate of 12% in separating normal from abnormal heartbeats. We utilized this outlier removal method in a biometric system and examined it on a fingertip acquired ECG database. The biometric system had an equal error rate of 5.94% in comparison to 12.35% to a state of the art approach.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Vigilance lapse identification using sparse EEG electrode arrays</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Mental vigilance monitoring is useful in helping people improve their prowess in situations such as sports, musical performance or occupational demands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide appropriate information for identification of vigilance lapses; however, almost all of the previous EEG-based vigilance--monitoring studies require high--density EEG montages, with the added inconvenience of conductive gels and the requirement for accurate placement of electrodes. In this paper we propose a practical machine learning approach for identification of vigilance lapses using EEG signals recorded from a very sparse electrode configuration with only 4 electrodes: 2 electrodes at the forehead and 2 electrodes behind the ears. This is a challenging problem since these four electrodes are easily contaminated by eye blinks and muscle artifacts. The performance of the proposed machine-learning based algorithm is demonstrated in a real world scenario where vigilance lapses are identified with about 95\% accuracy. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Joint Time Invariant and Time Dependent Brain Connectivity Network Estimation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Inferring interactions between discrete brain regions has being increasingly recognized as important for studying brain in both normal and disease states. In addition to static brain network inference, the temporal dynamics of brain connectivity access the brain in the temporal dimension and provide a new perspective to the understanding of brain function. Most current brain network modeling approaches are based on assumptions that brain connections are purely static or purely dynamic. This may be unrealistic as the brain must strike a balance between stability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose making joint inference of time invariant connections and time varying coupling patterns by employing a multitask learning model followed by a least square approach to precisely estimate the connectivity coefficients. When applied to a real resting state fMRI study, the eigenconnectivity networks were extracted to obtain the representative patterns of both static and dynamic brain connectivity networks. The results demonstrated that the static and dynamic connectivity networks may represent complementary information on the brain connectivity patterns. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Blood Vessels Extraction from Retinal Images Using Combined 2D Gabor Wavelet Transform with Local Entropy Thresholding and Alternative Sequential Filter</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Retinal blood vessels extraction is a primary step for detecting eye diseases including diabetic retinopathy which causes blindness. It also simplifies other image processing techniques such as classification. Since manual extraction is a long task and it requires training, many automated methods have been proposed. In this paper, an algorithm for extracting blood vessels from fundus images has been proposed. The algorithm is based on two dimensional Gabor filter, local entropy thresholding and alternative sequential filter. A MATLAB code has been used to evaluate the proposed algorithm on DRIVE database. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Predicting the Depth of Anaesthesia with 40-Hz ASSR</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>An algorithm for predicting the amplitude of 40-Hz auditory steady state response (ASSR), which is an indicative of depth of anaesthesia, is presented in this paper. The amplitude of 40-Hz ASSR is an indicative of the depth of anaesthesia. Predicting this amplitude will help anesthesiologists in choosing the dose of the anaesthetic agents and have an estimation of the patients' next depth of anaesthesia state. The method is&#13;
applied to the 40-Hz ASSR signals recorded from 20 human subjects during surgical operation. The algorithm uses sequential feature selection and multi-linear regression for choosing the most informative features and estimating the amplitude of ASSR on the next cycle and at the end of induction stage, when the patient looses his/her eyelash reflex. The algorithm uses the dose of anaesthetic drug, some of the demographics and medical parameters of the patients and their previous ASSR cycles for prediction. As the system provided with more ASSR cycles, the error in prediction decreases and estimation gets more accurate. The method is applied on the induction phase where patients' depth of anaesthesia changes very fast but it is applicable to all&#13;
other stages of anaesthesia as well.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Maximum Likelihood Cardiac Conduction Velocity Estimation in the Presence of Ambiguities in the Locations and Activation Times of the Recording Points</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>The cardiac conduction velocity vector (CCVV) provides valuable information that is used to distinguish/treat various heart diseases. The CCVV can be estimated using the intracardiac electrograms; i.e., the activation times (ATs) and locations of the recording catheter's electrodes are used for the VV estimation. In practice, the ATs and locations of the electrodes are estimated, and if their estimation errors are not taken into consideration, they may significantly degrade the quality of the velocity estimation. Thus, in this paper, we assume that the locations and the ATs of the catheter's electrodes are contaminated with white Gaussian noise with known variances, and we derive the maximum likelihood (ML) cardiac velocity estimator for the planar wavefront. We further calculate the ML estimate of the AT that the planar wavefront reaches at any given location. Our simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed ML estimators for the velocity and AT, and they also confirm the validity of the derived relations for the covariance of the error of the estimators.&#13;

        <papertitle>Two Computationally Efficient Intracardiac Conduction Velocity Estimators: Error Analysis for the Planar Wavefronts</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>The cardiac conduction velocity vector (VV) provides insight into the characteristics of the myocardial tissue and can be deployed to treat different heart diseases. The cardiac VV can be estimated by processing the intracardiac electrograms. In this paper, we analyse the VV estimation error of two computationally efficient heuristic estimators: 1- maximum time difference (MTD) and 2- minimum velocity (MinV). In the MTD, the estimated velocity is a vector in the direction of the vector that connects the first to the last catheter's activated electrode, and the magnitude of the VV is estimated as the ratio of the distance between two electrodes to the delay between their ATs. In the MinV, using a similar procedure as the MTD, we assign a VV to each available electrode pair of the catheter, and the VV with the smallest magnitude is selected as the final estimated VV. We derive the average absolute value and average squared absolute value of the VV estimation error of the MTD and MinV methods for a planar wavefront in a two-dimensional case and confirm the accuracy of our analysis by simulating synthetic data.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Regressing force-myographic signals collected by an armband to estimate torque exerted by the wrist: a preliminary investigation</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Human-machine-interfaces (HMI) have a key role for translating human intention into control commands to external devices. Different wearable techniques, including surface electromyography (sEMG), have been proposed for acquiring bio-signals that reveal the human intention. In this paper, we explore an easy-to-use wearable sensor device that can be used to measure force-myography (FMG) signals. We assess if FMG signals can be used to estimate isometric torque of hand pronation/supination, wrist flexion/extension or wrist radial/ulnar using a regression model. Results of our investigation report an average accuracy over 90%. The related standard deviation was 0.02 showing consistency of data among different data collecting sessions. The proposed FMG-based device shows therefore promising performance for different future applications, which may include: monitoring the progress of patients during exercising in arm rehabilitation programs; proportional control of robotic hand prosthesis; and control of robot movements.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Towards efficient heart rate variability estimation in artifact-induced Photoplethysmography signals</papertitle>
        <trackname>Bioengineering</trackname>
        <abstract>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has become a marker for various health and disease conditions. Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors integrated in wear- able/portable devices such as smart watches and phones are widely used to measure heart activities. HRV requires accurate estimation of time interval between consecutive peaks in the PPG signal. However, PPG signal is very sensitive to artifacts which may lead to wrong HRV estimation if fault peaks are detected. In this paper, we present an adaptive real-time approach that employs Linear Prediction analysis (LPC) and Wavelet transformation techniques for estimating HRV from PPG signal recorded by wearable devices. Our algorithm out- performs two other related algorithms, especially for low PPG signal to noise ratio. By comparing the proposed algorithm to the ground truth recorded simultaneously from ECG, an average temporal resolution of 8.7 ms was achieved with a sensitivity of 82.9% and a positive predictive value of 82.7%.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Converter Outage Fault Ride-Through Control Strategy For Offshore MT-HVDC Network</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a fault ride through (FRT) control strategy for offshore MT HVDC (multi-terminal high voltage DC), which integrates type-4 wind-turbine based offshore-wind farms. The proposed control strategy are responsible for relieving DC voltage rise effects during a temporary grid side (GS) converter outage, by setting local measurements and communication-free control rules in wind farm (WF) converters and wind generators local controllers. The functionality, feasibility and robustness of the proposed control strategy are presented in this paper through simulations of a three terminals offshore HVDC network system</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Parametric Dynamic Phasor Model of Line-Commutated Rectifier Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Recently, the generalized averaging method (GAM) has received significant attention to effectively model and simulate dynamics of ac-dc power systems using dynamic phasors (DPs). The conventional analytical DP (ADP) models of line-commutated rectifiers (LCRs) have been derived based on switch functions, which are only valid for certain operating mode. In this paper, a new parametric DP (PDP) model of LCRs is presented, which relates the ac-dc subsystems through a set of parametric algebraic functions that account for various loading conditions. Simulation results validate the advantageous accuracy of the proposed PDP model of LCRs, and demonstrate its superior numerical efficiency over the time-domain detailed model and the prior ADP model.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Fuzzy Set-Point Modulation Scheme for Control Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper introduces a fuzzy inference engine for modulating the set-point of a control system to improve system transient response while retaining its target steady state operating point. Using the system's error and its rate of change, the fuzzy set-point modulator introduces a temporary change in the system set-point in order to reduce the system's settling time and damp oscillations. This paper describes the principles of the proposed fuzzy set-point modulation scheme on a second-order system, and then applies this technique to a complex vector-controlled power-electronic induction machine drive system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Saturable Voltage-Behind-Reactance Model of Six-Phase Synchronous Machine in Hybrid AC and DC Generation System</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Six-phase synchronous machines are utilized in special applications, such as naval and aircraft power systems, due to lower power per-phase, less mechanical stress, and higher reliability compared to three-phase machines. The voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) machine models offer advantages in transient simulation programs such as capability of interfacing with arbitrary networks without snubber circuits and reduced system matrix size, compared to conventional qd0 model and coupled circuit phase-domain model (CCPD). This paper presents a VBR model of a six-phase synchronous machine that considers stator mutual inductances and main flux saturation. Performance of the proposed saturable VBR model is investigated in a hybrid ac-dc generation system. Simulation results verify numerical advantages of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and simulation speed over the conventional CCPD and qd0 models.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On-board Direct-Drive Surface Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine with Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings for Electric Vehicles</papertitle>
        <trackname>Power and Energy Circuits and Systems</trackname>
        <abstract>Removal of the gear-box from an existing electric vehicle (EV) power-train incorporating direct-drive topology is expected to improve motor-to-wheel efficiency. Firstly, this paper discusses the need for a novel direct-drive scheme employing a single on-board motor in an EV. Electric machine and drive design targets for such a supermini EV with direct-drive scheme are fixed based on analytical equations, benchmark data obtained from commercially available EV motors, drives, transmissions and literature study. Employing a comprehensive vehicle dynamics model of the supermini EV, machine design targets previously fixed are further refined to yield desired dynamic and steady-state performance of the EV over an urban drive cycle. An on-board direct-drive surface permanent magnet synchronous machine with fractional slot concentrated windings in the stator is designed. The machine's performance is then analyzed using its electromagnetic model in conjunction with maximum-torque-per-ampere control scheme over the entire speed range of the motor. Results from finite element analysis are discussed in detail to show that that the proposed direct-drive scheme in EV is worth studying and the machine designed can be improved in order to obtain efficiency improvement in an EV drivetrain system and hence extend the driving range of EV. </abstract>

        <papertitle>Sampling control in environmental monitoring systems using recurrent neural networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Minimization of energy consumption of environmental monitoring systems is important to ensure their extended operational lifetime and low maintenance costs. One possible way to conserve energy is the use of low-frequency analog-to-digital conversion devices and associated data sampling techniques. In this paper, a new approach to lowering sampling frequency using model-based data imputation. Recorded data is used to develop models based on time-delay recurrent neural network. While sampling at low frequencies, the models are used to predict future and missing values. The models are updated when predicted values differ significantly from the actual measurements. The proposed approach is demonstrated using actual measurements sampled at different frequencies. The results are thoroughly analyzed from the perspective of approximation error and energy savings.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Superpixel-based Image Recognition for Food Images</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>Food is an inseparable part of people's lives. Food image recognition has been attracting increasing attention due to the advances of Internet, imaging techniques and social media. Approaches for food image recognition, besides the computationally expensive deep learning approach, can be categorized into two main directions: low-level approaches and mid-level approaches. Low-level approaches extract low-level local features, such as SIFT or SURF, following feature encoding techniques. Mid-level approaches extract higher-level image parts and have shown promising results in many recognition problems. Compared with other image recognition problems, food images are highly deformable with large intra-class variance and small between-class variance. In this paper, considering that superpixels segmentation methods can successfully segment small food items and larger food parts, we propose superpixel-based food image recognition frameworks to mine mid-level superpixel food parts-to-class similarity. We evaluate the proposed frameworks on UEC Food dataset, and show promising results when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. &#13;

        <papertitle>Feature Selection to Simplify BDI for Efficient Depression Identification</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a self-report questionnaire consisting of 21 question items, has been the most extensively used for depression assessment. The problem of interest here is to identify a subset of questions in the BDI that are most predictive of depression and can reveal gender differences between depression profiles. We investigate feature selection techniques to select a subset of items in the BDI for depression identification and suggest a new simple decision-making rule that yields high classification accuracy. Distinct features in the BDI are identified for depression assessment in men and women. For males, the most useful features include mood, loss of libido, work inhibition, self-accusation, social withdrawal while indecisiveness, mood, work inhibition, distortion of body image, crying are most useful for depression identification in females.</abstract>

        <papertitle>HyperSpectral Classification with Adaptively Weighted L1-norm regularization</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>&#13;
Sparse regression methods have been proven effective in a wide range of signal processing problems such as image compression, speech coding, channel equalization, linear regression and classification. In this paper we develop a new method of hyperspectral image classification based on the sparse unmixing algorithm SUnSAL for which a pixel adaptive L1-norm regularization term is introduced. Our algorithm manages to preserve the benefits of convexity (i.e. it does not get caught in unfavorable local minima for one or more classes at a time), while achieving comparable overall accuracies (OA's) and kappa coefficients of agreement as the non-convex state of the art algorithms KSOMP and KSSP.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Detection of Largest Possible Repeated Patterns in Indian Audio Songs using Spectral Features</papertitle>
        <trackname>Signal Theory and Signal Processing</trackname>
        <abstract>In the field of Content Based Music Information Retrieval (CB-MIR), researchers are always looking for better ways to classify songs aside from the existing classifiers such as genre, mood, scale, tempo, etc. By determining a way to isolate and extracting maximum length repeating patterns (MLRPs) in a music file, we can analyze them in order to describe another potential classifier: complexity. Extraction of repeating patterns would also allow users to easily extract ringtones from their favorite songs. In this paper, an effort has been made to describe a method to extract repeating patterns from a given music file, through direct signal level as well as feature level comparison, for further use as ringtones, or for analysis to determine complexity. Features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), modulation spectral features (MSFs) and jitter are computed to reduce the computational time observed in signal level comparison.</abstract>
