                    <p>The 29<sup>th</sup> Annual IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE 2016) will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from May 15 to 18, 2016. CCECE is the flagship conference for researchers, students, and professionals in the area of Electrical and Computer Engineering from Canada and around the world to meet annually in a Canadian city to disseminate their research advancements and discoveries, to network and exchange ideas in order to strengthen existing partnerships and foster new collaborations. CCECE 2016 general theme, <strong><em>Advancing Society Through Electrical and Computer Engineering</em></strong> reflects the profound impact of ECE research on our daily lives. CCECE 2016 will address the following many themes which are listed and described to the right.</p>

                    </figure>

					<p>Our theme, <em>Advancing Society Through Electrical and Computer Engineering</em> reflects the profound impact of ECE research on our daily lives. Take a moment and reflect how information and communication technology now governs the way we do business and much of the way we socialize. The Internet continues to grow quickly and is becoming more accessible to the third world. Our robot population and capability is increasing. Our whole solar system is becoming more familiar and is more beckoning than ever before.  In short, we are amid the information and communications revolution, and the driver for all these advances is the technology produced by research in ECE.</p>

					<p>Electrical Engineering started to separate from physics over a hundred years ago and the gap in their respective research emphases has continued to widen. Computer science in turn separated from electrical engineering and these areas have already started diverging, although computer engineering retains its close connections, as the title ECE suggests. Many popular applications such as biomedical engineering are also developing from electrical engineering. ECE has become a core science in its own right, using the tools of mathematics and physics (and even chemistry for aspects of new electronic materials), while also riding the world of computers. From our toolkit from the natural sciences, new scientific areas have necessarily been created within ECE, from information theory to cognitive techniques, and other areas that most of us haven’t imagined yet will evolve in the future. ECE is creating the <em>unnatural sciences</em>!</p>


                    <p>There will be high quality tutorials and keynotes to expand your knowledge of ECE technology. Poster sessions will be highlighted, where you can directly discuss new results with their creators. Your ECE research will be binned into 8 tracks for this conference. The eclectic nature of ECE research means that some projects may not appear to fit into one of the tracks, but don’t worry - we will make a clear place for reporting any quality ECE research project at CCECE. The papers will be archived in IEEE Xplore.</p>

                    <p>Vancouver is Canada’s west coast hub and is an amazing place to visit or live in. The conference venue is within walking distance of many attractions such as Stanley Park and award-winning shopping and restaurants. We can promise that the sea-to-sky experience will be unforgettable, from the superb Vancouver aquarium to the panoramic views from Grouse Mountain where grizzlies can be viewed. Take a few days before and after the conference to check the gulf islands, whale watching, and even the Rockies!</p>

                    <p>On behalf of a distinguished organizing committee, please feel a warm invitation to attend CCECE 2016. We are excited to see you and your recent work. We promise a high quality and fun conference. Your attendance will allow you to contribute, absorb and enjoy this snapshot of a revolution!</p>
