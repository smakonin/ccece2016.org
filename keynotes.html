Canada was involved and in fact MDA produced the first digitally processed satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image from SeaSAT data. Canada went on to develop a sequence of SAR satellites, with RADARSAT-1 launched in 1995 and operating until 2013, RADARSAT-2 launched in 2007 and currently operating, and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission currently under development with a planned launch in 2018. In this talk, an overview of spaceborne SAR in Canada will be given, from SeaSAT, to the RADARSAT Constellation Mission, and beyond.</p>

Alan has worked on RCM since its very beginning as a study in 2003 until the present, where the program is in the manufacturing stage. Alan joined MDA in 1999 to work on RADARSAT-2 as a senior systems engineer. Prior to working at MDA, Alan worked on RADARSAT-1 SAR processing at Array Systems in Toronto. Alan has a Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT (in the field of integral geometry). While his degree was in pure mathematics, the radar imaging systems he currently works on are applications of the types of mathematics he used to study and develop.</p>
