                    <p class="descr">Quantum computing is a nascent field and D-Wave Systems is the only company in the world to build scalable quantum processors. Having produced three generations of quantum computing technology we have a unique perspective on the field and where it is heading. From the advent of the famous Shor algorithm for factoring in 1994 to some of the innovations behind D-Wave's quantum processors, this talk will provide an overview of the major developments in quantum computing and how this exciting field is growing.</p>

                    <p class="descr"><strong>Jeremy Hilton</strong> joined D-Wave directly after obtaining his BSc. in Physics from the University of British Columbia. Since 2004 he and his team of engineers and scientists have created a world-class R&amp;D facility and built the world's first scalable quantum processors. Mr. Hilton also led the creation of the most advanced superconducting integrated circuit foundry, where D-Wave's quantum processors are produced. Mr. Hilton has brought technical leadership to projects ranging from design, model, and test of superconducting integrated circuits to the development of low-noise superconducting fabrication processes, and has led the teams responsible for aggressively scaling D-Wave’s quantum computers. Mr. Hilton is a named inventor on 28 granted US patents.</p>

                    <p class="descr"><strong class="subsec">ABSTRACT:</strong></p>
                    <p class="descr">Canada has an illustrious history in spaceborne radar remote sensing (SRRS). Civilian SRRS started with SeaSAT, a NASA mission in 1978. Canada was involved and in fact MDA produced the first digitally processed satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image from SeaSAT data. Canada went on to develop a sequence of SAR satellites, with RADARSAT-1 launched in 1995 and operating until 2013, RADARSAT-2 launched in 2007 and currently operating, and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission currently under development with a planned launch in 2018. In this talk, an overview of spaceborne SAR in Canada will be given, from SeaSAT, to the RADARSAT Constellation Mission, and beyond.</p>
                    <p class="descr"><strong class="subsec">BIO:</strong></p>
                    <p class="descr"><strong>Alan Thompson</strong> is the Chief Systems Engineer on the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), at MDA. RCM is a constellation of three Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites being developed by MDA for the Canadian Space Agency. Alan has worked on RCM since its very beginning as a study in 2003 until the present, where the program is in the manufacturing stage. Alan joined MDA in 1999 to work on RADARSAT-2 as a senior systems engineer. Prior to working at MDA, Alan worked on RADARSAT-1 SAR processing at Array Systems in Toronto. Alan has a Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT (in the field of integral geometry). While his degree was in pure mathematics, the radar imaging systems he currently works on are applications of the types of mathematics he used to study and develop.</p>
